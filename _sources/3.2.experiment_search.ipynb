    "Search is at the core of the RAG pattern. Precise, efficient, and consistent search is critical when implementing a solution based on RAG.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four types of search [options](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/use-your-data?tabs=ai-search#search-options): keyword search, semantic search, vector search, hybrid search.\n",
