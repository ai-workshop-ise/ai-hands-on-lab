Therefore, experimentation platform, data and evaluation flows are the most important aspects that bring differences into DevOps making it as LLMOps. Technology Agnostic LLMOps for Prompt Engineering Implementation\n\nPrior to building the architecture, we need to build a few assumptions regarding to components that must be presented in any implementation. At least two of them should be available: the DevOps and Experimentation platform. The first component is the DevOps system, which is an obvious component. We assume that Git is one of the tools that should be used for prompt engineering. A prompt is not located in the vacuum, but it can be found in a code repository alongside experimentation scripts and notebooks. Therefore, if a software engineer or a data scientist is willing to create or tune prompts or related code, the first step there is to create a new branch. We would like to emphasize this obvious step here, because the branch name is an element that will allow us to build some rules around experiment naming. Any service that works on the top of Git including GitHub, Azure DevOps, Jenkins, GitLab, is good enough to host branches, invoke builds/flows and orchestrate the whole end-to-end process up to deployment into production. Another important tool is a service that allows us to log experiments alongside with their results.",

Therefore, a structured\napproach to monitoring and telemetry isn't only beneficial but critical. Monitoring offers a real-time lens into an application's health, performance,\nand functionality. For generative AI, this means observing the model's\naccuracy, understanding user interactions, optimizing costs, and more. Telemetry provides the raw data necessary for such monitoring, encompassing\neverything from logs and traces to specific metrics. This guide walks you through the essentials of monitoring generative AI\napplications. It offers a roadmap for capturing, analyzing, and acting on\ntelemetry data to help your AI services run efficiently. We focus on key\noperational telemetry across the entire generative AI application. Why monitor generative AI applications\n\nGenerative AI applications are reshaping how industries operate, making them\ninvaluable assets. Without the right monitoring, even the most\nsophisticated generative AI application can stumble. Here's why it's paramount\nto keep a close watch on these systems:\n\nEnsuring model accuracy and reliability: Models evolve, and with\nevolution can come drifts in accuracy. Continuous monitoring ensures the\noutputs remain aligned with expectations and standards. Furthermore, as these\nmodels learn and adapt, monitoring helps in verifying the consistency and\nreliability of their predictions. Detecting anomalies and performance issues: Generative AI can\noccasionally produce unexpected results or behave erratically due to\nunforeseen data scenarios or underlying system issues. Monitoring can\nidentify such anomalies, enabling quick mitigation. Understanding user interactions and feedback: Monitoring user\ninteractions gives insights into how well the application meets user needs. By observing user queries, feedback, and behavior patterns, one can make\niterative improvements to enhance the user experience. Validating costs and optimizing operations: Running AI models,\nespecially at scale, can be resource-intensive. Monitoring provides visibility\ninto resource consumption and operation costs, aiding in optimization and\nensuring the most efficient use of available resources. Basic Concepts in Telemetry\n\nTelemetry is the process of collecting and transmitting data from remote\nsources to receiving stations for analysis. In the realm of generative AI\napplications, telemetry involves capturing key operational data to monitor\nand improve the system's performance and user experience. Here are some\nfoundational concepts:\n\nLogs: Records of events that occur within an\napplication. For generative AI, logs can capture information such as user\ninput, model responses, and any errors or exceptions that arise. Traces: Traces offer a detailed path of a request as it moves through\nvarious components of a system. Tracing can be invaluable in understanding\nthe flow of data from embeddings to chat completions, pinpointing bottlenecks,\nand troubleshooting issues. Metrics: These are quantitative measures that give insights into the\nperformance, health, and costs of a system. In AI, metrics can\nencompass everything from request rate and error percentages to specific model\nevaluation measures. Telemetry is the backbone of a well-monitored AI system, offering the\ninsights necessary for continuous improvement. For a deeper dive into these\nconcepts and more, check the Engineering Fundamentals for\nlogging,\ntracing,\nand metrics. Logging\n\nIn generative AI applications, logging plays a pivotal role in shedding light\non interactions, system behavior, and overall health. Here are some recommended logs for OpenAI services:\n\nRequests: Logging request metrics, such as response times,\nstop reasons, and specific model parameters to understand both the demand and\nperformance of the system. Input prompts: Capturing user inputs helps developers grasp how users\nare engaging with the system, paving the way for potential model refinements.",

However, in the context of server monitoring, there is a metric that reflects the available disk space - available GBs or available disk space in other units. \n\nOne approach to interpreting available disk space usage is to set thresholds for warning and critical levels, and alert when either one is breached. For instance, if you set a warning threshold at 20% of available disk space, you would be alerted if your server's available GBs counter drops below that level. And if you set a critical level at 10% or below that, you would be alerted to take action as soon as possible. \n\nIt is important to be vigilant when it comes to available disk space, as a low available disk space can lead to performance issues, data loss, and system failure.

        "retrieved_context": "Be careful when deserializing user requests, and use buffer limits. ie: HTTP/gRPC Servers can set limits on how much data will get read from the socket. Set alerts for utilization, servers restarting, or going offline to detect when your system may be failing. These types of errors can result in Cascading Failures, where a non-critical portion of your system takes down the entire service. Plan accordingly, and make sure to put extra thought into how your system might degrade during failures. Backup Data\n\nData gets lost, corrupted, or accidentally deleted. It happens. Take data backups to help get your system back up online as soon as possible. It can happen in the application stack, with code deleting or corrupting data, or at the storage layer by losing the volumes, or losing encryption keys. Consider things like:\n\nHow long will it take to restore data. How much data loss can you tolerate. How long will it take you to notice there is data loss. Look into the difference between snapshot and incremental backups. A good policy might be to take incremental backups on a period of N, and a snapshot backup on a period of M (where N < M). Target Uptime & Failing Gracefully\n\nIt's a known fact that systems cannot target 100% uptime. There are too many factors in today's software systems to achieve this, many outside of our control. Even a service that never gets updated and is 100% bug free will fail. Upstream DNS servers have issues all the time. Hardware breaks. Power outages, backup generators fail. The world is chaotic. Good services target some number of \"9's\" of uptime. ie: 99.99% uptime means that the system has a \"budget\" of 4 minutes and 22 seconds of uptime each month. Some months might achieve 100% uptime, which means that budget gets rolled over to the next month. What uptime means is different for everybody, and up to the service to define. A good practice is to use any leftover budget at the end of the period (ie: year, quarter), to intentionally take that service down, and ensure that the rest of your systems fail as expected. Often times other engineers and services come to rely on that additional achieved availability, and it can be healthy to ensure that systems fail gracefully. We can build graceful failure (or graceful degradation) into our software stack by anticipating failures. Some tactics include:\n\nFailover to healthy services\n\nLeader Election can be used to keep healthy services on standby in case the leader experiences issues. Entire cluster failover can redirect traffic to another region or availability zone. Propagate downstream failures of dependent services up the stack via health checks, so that your ingress points can re-route to healthy services. Circuit breakers can bail early on requests vs.",

The use of type hints throughout paired with linting and type hint checking avoids common errors that are tricky to debug. Projects should check Python code with automated tools. Linting should be added to build validation, and both linting and code formatting can be added to your pre-commit hooks and VS Code. Code Analysis / Linting\n\nThe 2 most popular python linters are Pylint and Flake8. Both check adherence to PEP8 but vary a bit in what other rules they check. In general Pylint tends to be a bit more stringent and give more false positives but both are good options for linting python code. Both Pylint and Flake8 can be configured in VS Code using the VS Code python extension. Flake8\n\nFlake8 is a simple and fast wrapper around Pyflakes (for detecting coding errors) and pycodestyle (for pep8).

The most common method people use as the replacement for the dependency is a mock, and\nmocking frameworks exist to help make this process easier. Many frameworks and articles use different meanings for the differences between test doubles. A test double is a generic\nterm for any \"pretend\" object used in place of a real one. This term, as well as others used in this page are the\ndefinitions provided by Martin Fowler. The most commonly used form of test double is Mocks, but there are many cases where Mocks perhaps are not the best\nchoice and Fakes should be considered instead. Stubs\n\nStub allows you to have predetermined behavior that substitutes real behavior. The dependency (abstract class or interface) is implemented as a stub with a logic as expected by the client. Stubs can be useful when the clients of the stubs all expect the same set of responses, e.g. you use a third party service. The key concept here is that stubs should never fail a unit or integration test where a mock can. Stubs do not require any sort of framework to run, but are usually supported by mocking frameworks to quickly build the stubs. Stubs are commonly used in combination with a dependency injection frameworks or libraries, where the real object is replaced by a stub implementation. Stubs can be useful especially during early development of a system, but since nearly every test requires its own stubs\n(to test the different states), this quickly becomes repetitive and involves a lot of boilerplate code. Rarely will you\nfind a codebase that uses only stubs for mocking, they are usually paired with other test doubles.",

It's important to guarantee that all code that is going to a development branch can represent working ML training pipelines. The only way to do that is to publish the pipeline and execute the pipelines on a toy data set. The toy dataset should be prepared in advance. It should be small enough to guarantee the pipelines won't spend much time on execution. Therefore, if we have changes in our ML training pipeline, we have to publish it and execute it on the toy dataset. The diagram above demonstrates the process that we explained in the section. Furthermore, you can see that there is a Build for Linting and Unit Testing. This Build can be an another policy to guarantee code quality. Pay attention so that if you have more than one pipeline in the project, you might need to implement several PR Builds. Ideally, one Build per pipeline, if it's available in your DevOps system. Our general recommendation is to have as many Builds for as many pipelines as we have.

        "retrieved_context": "Runtime Variables in GitHub Actions\n\nObjective\n\nWhile GitHub Actions is a popular choice for writing and running CI/CD pipelines, especially for open source projects hosted on GitHub, it lacks specific quality of life features found in other CI/CD environments. One key feature that GitHub Actions has not yet implemented is the ability to mock and inject runtime variables into a workflow, in order to test the pipeline itself. This provides a bridge between a pre-existing feature in Azure DevOps, and one that has not yet released inside GitHub Actions. Target Audience\n\nThis guide assumes that you are familiar with CI/CD, and understand the security implications of CI/CD pipelines. We also assume basic knowledge with GitHub Actions, including how to write and run a basic CI/CD pipeline, checkout repositories inside the action, use Marketplace Actions with version control, etc. We assume that you, as a CI/CD engineer, want to inject environment variables or environment flags into your pipelines and workflows in order to test them, and are using GitHub Actions to accomplish this. Usage Scenario\n\nMany integration or end-to-end workflows require specific environment variables that are only available at runtime. For example, a workflow might be doing the following:\n\nIn this situation, testing the pipeline is extremely difficult without having to make external calls to the resource. In many cases, making external calls to the resource can be expensive or time-consuming, significantly slowing down inner loop development. Azure DevOps, as an example, offers a way to define pipeline variables on a manual trigger:\n\nGitHub Actions does not do so yet. Solution\n\nTo workaround this, the easiest solution is to add runtime variables to either commit messages or the PR Body, and grep for the variable. GitHub Actions provides grep functionality natively using a contains function, which is what we shall be specifically using. In scope:\n\nWe will scope this to injecting a single environment variable into a pipeline, with a previously known key and value. Out of Scope:\n\nWhile the solution is obviously extensible using shell scripting or any other means of creating variables, this solution serves well as the proof of the basic concept. No such scripting is provided in this guide. Additionally, teams may wish to formalize this process using a PR Template that has an additional section for the variables being provided. This is not however included in this guide. Security Warning:\n\nThis is NOT for injecting secrets as the commit messages and PR body can be retrieved by a third party, are stored in\n\ngit log, and can otherwise be read by a malicious individual using a variety of tools. Rather, this is for testing a workflow that needs simple variables to be injected into it, as above. If you need to retrieve secrets or sensitive information, use the\n\nGitHub Action for Azure Key Vault or some other similar secret storage and retrieval service. Commit Message Variables\n\nHow to inject a single variable into the environment for use, with a specified key and value. In this example, the key is COMMIT_VAR and the value is [commit var]. Pre-requisites:\n\nPipeline triggers are correctly set up to trigger on pushed commits (Here we will use actions-test-branch as the branch of choice)\n\nCode Snippet:\n\n{% raw %}\n\n```yaml\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - actions-test-branch\n\njobs:\n  Echo-On-Commit:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: \"Checkout Repository\"\n        uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n```\n\n```\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nAvailable as a .YAML here. Code Explanation:\n\nThe first part of the code is setting up Push triggers on the working branch and checking out the repository, so we will not explore that in detail. {% raw %}\n\nyaml\n- name: \"Set flag from Commit\"\n  env:\n    COMMIT_VAR: ${{ contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[commit var]') }}\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nThis is a named step inside the only Job in our GitHub Actions pipeline. Here, we set an environment variable for the step: Any code or action that the step calls will now have the environment variable available. {% raw %}\n\nyaml\nrun: |\n  if ${COMMIT_VAR} == true; then\n    echo \"flag=true\" >> $GITHUB_ENV\n    echo \"flag set to true\"\n  else\n    echo \"flag=false\" >> $GITHUB_ENV\n    echo \"flag set to false\"\n  fi\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nThe run command here checks to see if the COMMIT_VAR variable has been set to true, and if it has, it sets a secondary flag to true, and echoes this behavior. It does the same if the variable is false.",

Using a docker image\n\nAnother way to run Azurite is using docker, using default HTTP endpoint\n\n{% raw %}\n\nbash\ndocker run -p 10000:10000 mcr.microsoft.com/azure-storage/azurite azurite-blob --blobHost 0.0.0.0\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nDocker Compose is another option and can run the same docker image using the docker-compose.yml file below. {% raw %}\n\nyaml\nversion: '3.4'\nservices:\n  azurite:\n    image: mcr.microsoft.com/azure-storage/azurite\n    hostname: azurite\n    volumes:\n      - ./cert/azurite:/data\n    command: \"azurite-blob --blobHost 0.0.0.0 -l /data --cert /data/127.0.0.1.pem --key /data/127.0.0.1-key.pem --oauth basic\"\n    ports:\n      - \"10000:10000\"\n      - \"10001:10001\"\n\n{% endraw %}\n\n2. Run tests on your local machine\n\nPython 3.8.7 is used for this, but it should be fine on other 3.x versions as well. Install and run Azurite for local tests:\n\nOption 1: using npm:\n\n{% raw %}\n\nbash\n   # Install Azurite\n   npm install -g azurite\n   # Create azurite directory\n   mkdir c:/azurite\n   # Launch Azurite for Windows\n   azurite --silent --location c:\\azurite --debug c:\\azurite\\debug.log\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nOption 2: using docker\n\n{% raw %}\n\nbash\n   docker run -p 10000:10000 mcr.microsoft.com/azure-storage/azurite azurite-blob --blobHost 0.0.0.0\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nIn Azure Storage Explorer, select Attach to a local emulator\n\nProvide a Display name and port number, then your connection will be ready, and you can use Storage Explorer to manage your local blob storage. To test and see how these endpoints are running you can attach your local blob storage to the Azure Storage Explorer.",

Fine-tuning may also cause over-fitting or catastrophic forgetting. Therefore, we advise doing fine-tuning only if needed, and only after you have exhausted the in-context learning methods. Below are a few recommendations for fine-tuning. For more information, see fine-turning recommendations. Start with smaller models especially for simple tasks. Smaller models can be faster, cheaper, and easier to use and fine-tune, and they can also be more interpretable and controllable. Try fine-tuning using different data formats. Different data formats can affect the model's input and output representations, and some may be more suitable or effective for your task or domain than others.

This is the recommended approach for pre-production or production environments. Accessing protected resources from a local machine implies one of the following options:\n\nUse a VPN\n\nUse a jump box\n\nWith SSH activated (less secure)\n\nWith Bastion (recommended approach)\n\nHowever, a developer may want to deploy a test environment (in a non-production subscription) for their tests during development phase, without the complexity of networking. In addition, infrastructure code should not be duplicated: it has to be the same whether resources are deployed in a production like environment or in development environment. Option\n\nThe idea is to offer, via a single boolean variable, the option to deploy resources behind a VNet or not using one infrastructure code base. Securing resources behind a VNet usually implies that public accesses are disabled and private endpoints are created. This is something to have in mind because, as a developer, public access must be activated in order to connect to this environment. The deployment pipeline will set these resources behind a VNet and will secure them by removing public accesses. Developers will be able to run the same deployment script, specifying that resources will not be behind a VNet nor have public accesses disabled. Let's consider the following use case: we want to deploy a VNet, a subnet, a storage account with no public access and a private endpoint for the table. The magic variable that will help toggling security will be called behind_vnet, of type boolean. Let's implement this use case using Terraform.",

We want to avoid investing too much in the solution before we have:\n\nSufficient evidence that a solution would be the best technical solution given the business case\n\nSufficient evidence that a solution is compatible with the problem context\n\nSufficient evidence that a solution is possible\n\nSome vetted direction on what a solution should look like\n\nThis effort ensures quality solutions backed by the appropriate, thorough amount of consideration and evidence. When are feasibility studies useful? Every engagement can benefit from a feasibility study early in the project. Architectural discussions can still occur in parallel as the team works towards gaining a solid understanding and definition of what will be built. Feasibility studies can last between 4-16 weeks, depending on specific problem details, volume of data, state of the data etc. Starting with a 4-week milestone might be useful, during which it can be determined how much more time, if any, is required for completion. Who collaborates on feasibility studies? Collaboration from individuals with diverse skill sets is desired at this stage, including data scientists, data engineers, software engineers, PMs, human experience researchers, and domain experts.

Writing Style Guidelines\n\nThe following are some examples of writing style guidelines. Agree in your team which guidelines you should apply to your project documentation. Save your guidelines together with your documentation, so they are easy to refer back to. Wording\n\nUse inclusive language, and avoid jargon and uncommon words. The docs should be easy to understand\n\nBe clear and concise, stick to the goal of the document\n\nUse active voice\n\nSpell check and grammar check the text\n\nAlways follow chronological order\n\nVisit Plain English for tips on how to write documentation that is easy to understand. Document Organization\n\nOrganize documents by topic rather than type, this makes it easier to find the documentation\n\nEach folder should have a top-level README.md and any other documents within that folder should link directly or indirectly from that README.md\n\nDocument names with more than one word should use underscores instead of spaces, for example machine_learning_pipeline_design.md. The same applies to images\n\nHeadings\n\nStart with a H1 (single # in markdown) and respect the order H1 > H2 > H3 etc\n\nFollow each heading with text before proceeding with the next heading\n\nAvoid putting numbers in headings. Numbers shift, and can create outdated titles\n\nAvoid using symbols and special characters in headers, this causes problems with anchor links\n\nAvoid links in headers\n\nLinks\n\nAvoid duplication of content, instead link to the single source of truth\n\nLink but don't summarize. Summarizing content on another page leads to the content living in two places\n\nUse meaningful anchor texts, e.g. instead of writing Follow the instructions [here](../recipes/markdown.md) write Follow the [Markdown guidelines](../recipes/markdown.md)\n\nMake sure links to Microsoft docs do not contain the language marker /en-us/ or /fr-fr/, as this is automatically determined by the site itself.

        "retrieved_context": "Often, the objective may be simply presented, in a form such as \"to improve sales\". However, whilst this is ultimately the main goal, we would benefit from being more specific here. Suppose that we were to deploy a solution in November and then observed a December sales surge; how would we be able to distinguish how much of this was as a result of the new recommendation engine, as opposed to the fact that December is a peak buying season? A better objective, in this case, would be \"to drive additional sales by presenting the customer with items that they would not otherwise have purchased without the recommendation\". Here, the inputs that we can control are the choice of items that are presented to each customer, and the order in which they are displayed; considering factors such as how frequently these should change, seasonality, etc. The data required to evaluate a potential solution in this case would be which recommendations resulted in new sales, and an estimation of a customer's likeliness to purchase a specific item without a recommendation. Note that, whilst this data could also be used to build a recommendation engine, it is unlikely that this data will be available before a recommendation system has been implemented, so it is likely that we will have to use an alternate data source to build the model. We can get an initial idea of how to approach a solution to this problem by considering how it would be solved by a subject-matter expert. Thinking of how a personal stylist may provide a recommendation, they are likely to recommend items based on one or more of the following:\n\ngenerally popular items\n\nitems similar to those liked/purchased by the customer\n\nitems that were liked/purchased by similar customers\n\nitems which are complementary to those owned by the customer\n\nWhilst this list is by no means exhaustive, it provides a good indication of the data that is likely to be useful to us:\n\nitem sales data\n\ncustomer purchase histories\n\ncustomer demographics\n\nitem descriptions and tags\n\nprevious outfits, or sets, which have been curated by the stylist\n\nWe would then be able to use this data to explore:\n\na method of measuring similarity between items\n\na method of measuring similarity between customers\n\na method of measuring how complementary items are relative to one another\n\nwhich can be used to create and rank recommendations. Depending on the project scope, and available data, one or more of these areas could be selected to create hypotheses to be explored by the data science team. Some examples of such hypothesis statements could be:\n\nFrom the descriptions of each item, we can determine a measure of similarity between different items to a degree of accuracy which is specified by a stylist. Based on the behavior of customers with similar purchasing histories, we are able to predict certain items that a customer is likely to purchase; with a certainty which is greater than random choice. Using sets of items which have previously been sold together, we can formulate rules around the features which determine whether items are complementary or not which can be verified by a stylist. Next Steps\n\nTo ensure clarity and alignment, it is useful to summarize the envisioning stage findings focusing on proposed detailed scenarios, assumptions and agreed decisions as well next steps.

Using a docker image\n\nAnother way to run Azurite is using docker, using default HTTP endpoint\n\n{% raw %}\n\nbash\ndocker run -p 10000:10000 mcr.microsoft.com/azure-storage/azurite azurite-blob --blobHost 0.0.0.0\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nDocker Compose is another option and can run the same docker image using the docker-compose.yml file below. {% raw %}\n\nyaml\nversion: '3.4'\nservices:\n  azurite:\n    image: mcr.microsoft.com/azure-storage/azurite\n    hostname: azurite\n    volumes:\n      - ./cert/azurite:/data\n    command: \"azurite-blob --blobHost 0.0.0.0 -l /data --cert /data/127.0.0.1.pem --key /data/127.0.0.1-key.pem --oauth basic\"\n    ports:\n      - \"10000:10000\"\n      - \"10001:10001\"\n\n{% endraw %}\n\n2. Run tests on your local machine\n\nPython 3.8.7 is used for this, but it should be fine on other 3.x versions as well. Install and run Azurite for local tests:\n\nOption 1: using npm:\n\n{% raw %}\n\nbash\n   # Install Azurite\n   npm install -g azurite\n   # Create azurite directory\n   mkdir c:/azurite\n   # Launch Azurite for Windows\n   azurite --silent --location c:\\azurite --debug c:\\azurite\\debug.log\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nOption 2: using docker\n\n{% raw %}\n\nbash\n   docker run -p 10000:10000 mcr.microsoft.com/azure-storage/azurite azurite-blob --blobHost 0.0.0.0\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nIn Azure Storage Explorer, select Attach to a local emulator\n\nProvide a Display name and port number, then your connection will be ready, and you can use Storage Explorer to manage your local blob storage. To test and see how these endpoints are running you can attach your local blob storage to the Azure Storage Explorer.",

        "retrieved_context": "The main idea behind this is to propagate the correlation information between HTTP request so other pieces of software can read this information and correctly correlate telemetry across microservices. The way to propagate this information is to use HTTP Headers for the Correlation Id, parent Correlation Id, etc. When you are in the scope of a HTTP Request, your tracing system should already have created four properties that you can use to send across your microservices. RequestId:0HLQV2BC3VP2T:00000001,\n\nSpanId:da13aa3c6fd9c146,\n\nTraceId:f11a03e3f078414fa7c0a0ce568c8b5c,\n\nParentId:5076c17d0a604244\n\nThis is an example of the four properties you can find which identify the current request. RequestId is the unique id that represent the current HTTP Request. SpanId is the default automatically generated span. You can have more than one Span that scope different functionality inside your software. TraceId represent the id for current log trace. ParentId is the parent span id, that in some case can be the same or something different. Example\n\nNow we are going to explore an example with 3 microservices that calls to each other in a row. This image is the summary of what is needed in each microservice to propagate the trace-id from A to C. The root caller is A and that is why it doesn't have a parent-id, only have a new trace-id. Next, A calls B using HTTP. To propagate the correlation information as part of the request, we are using two new headers based on the W3C Correlation specification, trace-id and parent-id. In this example because A is the root caller, A only sends its own trace-id to microservice B. When microservice B receives the incoming HTTP request, it checks the contents of these two headers. It reads the content of the trace-id header and sets its own parent-id to this trace-id (as shown in the green rectangle inside's B). In addition, it creates a new trace-id to signal that is a new scope for the telemetry. During the execution of microservice B, it also calls microservice C and repeats the pattern. As part of the request it includes the two headers and propagates trace-id and parent-id as well. Finally, microservice C, reads the value for the incoming trace-id and sets as his own parent-id, but also creates a new trace-id that will use to send telemetry about his own operations. Summary\n\nA number of Application Monitoring (APM) technology products already supports most of this Correlation Propagation. The most popular is OpenZipkin/B3-Propagation. W3C already proposed a recommendation for the W3C Trace Context, where you can see what SDK and frameworks already support this functionality. It's important to correctly implement the propagation specially when there are different teams that used different technology stacks in the same project. Consider using OpenTelemetry as it implements open-source cross-platform context propagation for end-to-end distributed transactions over heterogeneous components out-of-the-box. It takes care of automatically creating and managing the Trace Context object among a full stack of microservices implemented across different technical stacks.",

One of the challenges integrating Azure ML pipelines into AzDo CI/CD pipelines is that the Azure ML pipeline can take long time to execute and the Azure DevOps agent running CI/CD would timeout. The solution presented here uses agent-less Azure DevOps jobs and Azure ML ability to notify Azure DevOps upon the pipeline completion (aka Azure ML Job Wait). The Azure ML Wait Job is a special REST service the accepts a job id and Azure DevOps call back info. The callback will be invoked when a pipeline finishes either successfully or due to a failure. This callback can be used for CI/CD flows. There are two options of using the Azure ML Job Wait feature:\n\nUtilize Azure DevOps extension for Azure Machine Learning that is supporting by Azure ML team. Invoke the Azure ML Job Wait REST API directly using the InvokeRESTAPI task in Azure DevOps. Option 1. Using the extension\n\nWhile the feature is in preview, you need to fill this form to get access for yourself or for your customers. Once your request has been approved, you will be able to install the extension:\n\nThe following page contains very detailed information about how to use the extension. Additionally, we have added the extension into MLOps Template for Azure ML SDK v2 as well as MLOps Template for Azure CLI v2. Both templates demonstrate how to use the extension during the Continues Integration phase. This phase is a very common place to run a model long-running training on the full dataset. Option 2. Using the InvokeRESTAPI task\n\nAzure DevOps Builds have the Invoke Rest Api task which allows for the sending of an HTTP request and waiting for the response. To set it up the InvokeRESTAPI task a service connection is required. The connection doesn't contain any secure information, and it's just an object that contains an URI of a desired service. To setup it from Azure ML you can follow the steps below:\n\nSign in to your organization (https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization}}) and select your project. Select Project settings > Service connections. Select + New service connection, select Generic as the type of service connection that you need, and then select Next. Fill in the Server URL it should be in the following form: <https://{region}.experiments.azureml.net/webhook/v1.0/> where region is the region of your Azure ML workspace. The request to Azure ML will be authorized by providing the necessary information in the body so user name and password are not need to be filled in here. Specify the name of the service connection.

        "retrieved_context": "Best practices and optimising results with Azure Cognitive Search\n\nOverview\n\nInformation Retrieval (IR) systems (or \"search systems\") are systems that help users find their information needs in a collection. Information needs are something in the users' mind and are often represented in the form of queries. Understanding users\u2019 information needs and finding the right information for them requires an intelligent system that is beyond term matching. Azure Cognitive Search is a search-as-a-service cloud solution that gives developers APIs and tools for adding a rich search experience over private, heterogeneous content in web, mobile, and enterprise applications. Your code or a tool invokes data ingestion (indexing) to create and load an index. Optionally, you can add cognitive skills to apply AI processes during indexing. Doing so can add new information and structures useful for search and other scenarios. On the other side of your service, your application code issues query requests and handles responses. The search experience is defined in your client using functionality from Azure Cognitive Search, with query execution over a persisted index that you create, own, and store in your service. Functionality is exposed through a simple REST API or .NET SDK that masks the inherent complexity of information retrieval. In addition to APIs, the Azure portal provides administration and content management support, with tools for prototyping and querying your indexes. Because the service runs in the cloud, infrastructure and availability are managed by Microsoft. Potential Applications\n\nThere are various application scenarios where we can leverage Azure search besides building an enterprise search system to retrieve internal documents. Here are several potential application scenarios:\n\nQuestion-answering system: When we are developing a question answering system, we may consider a multi-stage system where the first stage is built on top of Azure search. For the second stage, we can implement complex natural language processing techniques (e.g. summarization) to generate answers. Systematic review or legal search: These types of retrieval problems are domain-specific, and they are recall-based, which aims to find all relevant documents. Pub/Sub systems: This is a type of search which we refer to as \"document routing\", where users\u2019 queries are often fixed, and documents come in a streaming fashion. In these systems, we may index user queries using Azure search, and route documents to the relevant queries. Geospatial Search: This is a type of search where you can search any items based on their geolocation. You can visualize results with a map. To help this type of search, you have a parameter, \"search area coordinates\", which provides a polygon to search your items on the map. Multi-media Search system: This is a type of search that allows for searching across multi-modal data types, i.e. other than text documents. We can ingest many document types with several data enhancing techniques such as image recognition, image detection, OCR text extraction from images, video transcribing and more. Examples of media search:\n\nImproving Video Search using AI - A full solution that automates the analysis of videos with Azure Video Indexer, creates and improves the search index with Video Indexer insights and optional metadata. Provides a web UI application to search and see results and logs the behavior and feedback of users (in order for the admin or data science team to improve the search index). Lastly it also provides a dashboard which displays statistics on platform usage and search performances. AI Enrichment Pipeline tutorial - Complete sample for processing text, image and video files through a full enrichment pipeline with event grid, service bus, functions, logic apps, cognitive services and video indexer\n\nExtracting and indexing data from forms. Azure Cognitive Search can index content extracted from forms so that they may be searched. Examples of searching data from forms:\n\nMicrosoft Fabric - Create a custom search engine and question-answering system\n\nAzure Cognitive Search from Forms\n\nAzure AI Search (Azure Cognitive Search) Search Types\n\nThere are three main types of searches in Azure AI Search for information retrieval:\n\nKeyword Search (Full-text search): matches plain text between the query and the data stored in the index in Azure AI Search. This search type is recommended when the case requires exact words matching like proper names, numbers, license plates, domain names, phrase etc.",

While this might be intended behavior for the pipeline in some situations (Perhaps you don't want to run a more involved, longer build or run a time-consuming test coverage suite if the CI process is failing), it means that steps need to be commented out or deleted when testing the pipeline itself. Instead, an additional step could check for a [skip ci $N] tag in either the commit messages or PR Body, and skip a specific stage of the CI build. This ensures that the final pipeline does not have changes committed to it that render it broken, as sometimes happens when commenting out/deleting steps. It additionally allows for a mechanism to repeatedly test individual steps by skipping the others, making developing the pipeline significantly easier.",

The diagram below, taken directly from the official VS Code docs, illustrates this:\n\nIf the above diagram is not clear, a basic analogy that might help you intuitively understand dev containers is to think of them as a union between Docker's interactive mode (docker exec -it 987654e0ff32), and the VS Code UI experience that you are used to. To set yourself up for the dev container experience described above, use your VS Code's Extension Marketplace to install the Remote Development Extension Pack. How can dev containers improve project collaboration? VS Code dev containers have improved project collaboration between developers on recent team projects by addressing two very specific problems:\n\nInconsistent local developer experiences within a team. Slow onboarding of developers joining a project. The problems listed above were addressed by configuring and then sharing a dev container definition. Dev containers are defined by their base image, and the artifacts that support that base image. The base image and the artifacts that come with it live in the .devcontainer directory. This directory is where configuration begins. A central artifact to the dev container definition is a configuration file called devcontainer.json. This file orchestrates the artifacts needed to support the base image and the dev container lifecycle. Installation of the Remote Development Extension Pack is required to enable this orchestration within a project repo. All developers on the team are expected to share and use the dev container definition (.devcontainer directory) in order to spin-up a container. This definition provides consistent tooling for locally developing an application across a team. The code snippets below demonstrate the common location of a .devcontainer directory and devcontainer.json file within a project repository. They also highlight the correct way to reference a Docker file. {% raw %}\n\nbash\n$ tree vs-code-remote-try-python  # main repo directory\n\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500.devcontainers\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500Dockerfile\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500devcontainer.json\n\n{% endraw %}\n\n{% raw %}\n\n```json\n\ndevcontainer.json\n\n{\n    \"name\": \"Python 3\",\n    \"build\": {\n        \"dockerfile\": \"Dockerfile\",\n        \"context\": \"..\",\n        // Update 'VARIANT' to pick a Python version: 3, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8\n        \"args\": {\"VARIANT\": \"3.8\"}\n    },\n}\n```\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nFor a list of devcontainer.json configuration properties, visit VS Code documentation on dev container properties.

For any commercial release of the software, E2E test verification plays an important role as it tests the entire application in an environment that exactly imitates real-world users like network communication, middleware and backend services interaction, etc. Finally, the E2E test is often performed manually as the cost of automating such test cases is too high to be afforded by any organization. Having said that, the ultimate goal of each organization is to make the e2e testing as streamlined as possible adding full and semi-automation testing components into the process. Hence, the various E2E testing frameworks and tools listed in this article come to the rescue.

        "retrieved_context": "It saves time on having to deploy & run, wait and then realize something is wrong in configuration. In addition, it also saves time on going through the logs to figure out what failed and why. Better user/developer experience - A simple reminder to the user that something in the configuration isn't in the right format can make all the difference between the joy of a successful deployment process and the intense frustration of having to guess what went wrong. For example, when there is a Boolean value expected, it can either be a string value like \"True\" or \"False\" or an integer value such as \"0\" or \"1\" . With configuration validation we make sure the meaning is correct for our application. Avoid data corruption and security breaches - Since the data arrives from an untrusted source, such as a user or an external webservice, it\u2019s particularly important to validate the input . Otherwise, it will run at the risk of performing errors, corrupting data, or, worse, be vulnerable to a whole array of injection attacks. What is Json Schema? JSON-Schema is the standard of JSON documents that describes the structure and the requirements of your JSON data. Although it is called JSON-Schema, it also common to use this method for YAMLs, as it is a super set of JSON. The schema is very simple; point out which fields might exist, which are required or optional, what data format they use. Other validation rules can be added on top of that basic premise, along with human-readable information. The metadata lives in schemas which are .json files as well. In addition, schema has the widest adoption among all standards for JSON validation as it covers a big part of validation scenarios. It uses easy-to-parse JSON documents for schemas and is easily extensible. How to Implement Schema Validation? Implementing schema validation is divided in two - the generation of the schemas and the validation of yaml/json files with those schemas. Generation\n\nThere are two options to generate a schema:\n\nFrom code - we can leverage the existing models and objects in the code and generate a customized schema. From data - we can take yaml/json samples which reflect the configuration in general and use the various online tools to generate a schema. Validation\n\nThe schema has 30+ validators for different languages, including 10+ for JavaScript, so no need to code it yourself. Integration Validation\n\nAn effective way to identify bugs in your build at a rapid pace is to invest early into a reliable suite of automated tests that validate the baseline functionality of the system:\n\nEnd to end integration tests\n\nInclude tests in your pipeline to validate the build candidate conforms to automated business functionality assertions. Any bugs or broken code should be reported in the test results including the failed test and relevant stack trace.",

In this case, you will be able to initialize your local environment and publish the pipeline from a local computer. Or, you can use a variable group in your favorite DevOps system to publish the pipeline from there. Make sure the pipeline includes needed files only rather than everything from the repository. For example, Azure ML supports .amlignore file. Use branch names and build IDs to enable developers modifying the pipeline simultaneously (see below). Branch name utilization\n\nThe biggest challenge of the ML pipeline development process is how to modify and test the same pipeline from different branches. If we use fixed names for all experiments, models, and pipeline names, it will be hard to differentiate your own artifacts working in a large team. To make sure we can locate all feature branch-related experiments, we recommend using the feature branch name to mark all pipelines. Also, use the branch name in experiments and artifact names. This way, it will be possible to differentiate pipelines from different branches and help data scientists to log various feature-branch runs under the same name. The designed scripts can be utilized to publish pipelines and execute them from a local computer or from a DevOps system. Below is an example of how you can define Python variables based on initial environment variables and on a branch name:\n\n```py\npipeline_type = os.environ.get('PIPELINE_TYPE')\nsource_branch = os.environ.get('BUILD_SOURCEBRANCHNAME')\n\nmodel_name = f\"{pipeline_type}{os.environ.get('MODEL_BASE_NAME')}{source_branch}\"\npipeline_name = f\"{pipeline_type}{os.environ.get('PIPELINE_BASE_NAME')}{source_branch}\"\nexperiment_name = f\"{pipeline_type}{os.environ.get('EXPERIMENT_BASE_NAME')}{source_branch}\"\n```\n\nYou can see that in the code above we are using branch name and pipeline type. The second one is useful if you have several pipelines. To get a branch name from a local computer, you can use the following code:\n\npy\n    git_branch = subprocess.check_output(\"git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD\",\n                                         shell=True,\n                                         universal_newlines=True)\n\nPull request builds\n\nLet\u2019s start with introduction of two branch types that we are going to use in the process:\n\nFeature branch: any branch owned by a developer to develop a feature.

In general, data drift components should be deployed in sync with inferencing infrastructure, because the inferencing service is responsible for collecting new data. The data drift components can be injected differently based on the inferencing scenario, for example:\n\nreal-time inferencing for supervised Machine Learning\n\nbatch inferencing for supervised Machine Learning\n\ninferencing for unsupervised Machine Learning scenarios (like clustering)\n\nWe are not evaluating near real-time inferencing scenarios for supervised ML because they are similar to real-time from a data drift operationalization perspective. We will discuss the following questions in this document:\n\nWhat a data drift workload is from an Azure ML technology perspective. How to deploy changes into data drift workloads. How to invoke data drift in an automated way or by request. How to collect the outcome from data drift workload and implement notifications. What the difference is for data drift operationalization between supervised vs unsupervised ML scenarios. Main Deployment Artifact\n\nBecause this document is more about data drift operations rather than about algorithms themselves, we can define a data drift implementation script as the main deployment artifact. While we won't go too deep in details about how it\u2019s implemented, we need to make some assumptions about it:\n\nThe script itself should have access to a training dataset that has been used to train the current model. In the case of unsupervised ML, it can be a baseline dataset that we are holding from a previous algorithm execution or that we used initially to test the selected Machine Learning approach. The script should have access to new data with the ability to group them by timeframes in order to execute the data drift algorithm on a new (most recent batch from previous execution) batch of data. In the case of batch inferencing or for unsupervised algorithms, the inferencing service can update the entire dataset at once, and filtering might be not required. The script requires some computational power that might not be limited to CPU or to a single machine (node/instance) only.",

For example, if you want the model to generate a summary of a news article, you can specify the number of sentences, the main points to cover, and the style of writing. Consider delineating key components of the prompt or desired completion format with keywords, symbols, or tags - this can help the LLM more clearly identify meaningful information and disambiguate detailed instructions. You can use a combination of strategies in a single prompt, e.g. indicating the start and end of the completion with phrases like \"Summary:\" and \"<|end|>\". You can also instruct the LLM to look for context provided in a certain format, which can help with more complex prompt templating - e.g. \"Summarize the text delimited with triple quotes.",

        "retrieved_context": "When using Arrange/Act/Assert, think\nof it like testing just one thing in the \"Act\" phase. There is some disagreement on whether testing one thing means \"assert one thing\" or \"test one state, with\nmultiple asserts if needed\". Both have their advantages and disadvantages, but as with most technical disagreements\nthere is no \"right\" answer. Consistency when writing your tests one way or the other is more important! Using a standard naming convention for all unit tests\n\nWithout having a set standard convention for unit test names, unit test names end up being either not descriptive\nenough, or duplicated across multiple different test classes. Establishing a standard is not only important for keeping\nyour code consistent, but a good standard also improves the readability and debug-ability of a test. In this article,\nthe convention used for all unit tests has been UnitName_StateUnderTest_ExpectedResult, but there are lots of other\npossible conventions as well, the important thing is to be consistent and descriptive. Having descriptive names such as\nthe one above makes it trivial to find the test when there is a failure, and also already explains what the expectation\nof the test was and what state caused it to fail. This can be especially helpful when looking at failures in a CI/CD\nsystem where all you know is the name of the test that failed - instead now you know the name of the test and exactly\nwhy it failed (especially coupled with a test framework that logs helpful output on failures). Things to Avoid\n\nSome common pitfalls when writing a unit test that are important to avoid:\n\nSleeps - A sleep can be an indicator that perhaps something is making a request to a dependency that it should not be. In general, if your code is flaky without the sleep, consider why it is failing and if you can remove the flakiness by\n  introducing a more reliable way to communicate potential state changes. Adding sleeps to your unit tests also breaks\n  one of our original tenets of unit testing: tests should be fast, as in order of milliseconds. If tests are taking on\n  the order of seconds, they become more cumbersome to run. Reading from disk - It can be really tempting to the expected value of a function return in a file and read that file\n  to compare the results. This creates a dependency with the system drive, and it breaks our tenet of keeping our unit\n  tests isolated and 100% reliable. Any outside dependency such as file system access could potentially cause\n  intermittent failures. Additionally, this could be a sign that perhaps the test or unit under test is too complex and\n  should be simplified. Calling third-party APIs - When you do not control a third-party library that you are calling into, it's impossible to\n  know for sure what that is doing, and it is best to abstract it out. Otherwise, you may be making REST calls or other\n  potential areas of failure without directly writing the code for it. This is also generally a sign that the design of\n  the system is not entirely testable. It is best to wrap third party API calls in interfaces or other structures so\n  that they do not get invoked in unit tests.",

The outcome should be end-user scenarios and personas to determine the real needs of the users.

Clone the repository. QuickStart folder: Copy the contents of the QuickStart folder in there repository that can be found on  https://github.com/mtirionMSFT/DocFxQuickStart to the root of the repository. Azure: Create a resource group in your Azure environment where the documentation website resources should be created. Create Azure resources: Fill in the default values in infrastructure/variables.tf and run the commands from Step 3 - Deploy Azure resources from your local machine to create the Azure Resources. Pipeline: Fill in the variables in .pipelines/documentation.yml, commit the changes and push the contents of the repository to your branch (possibly through a PR). Now you can create a pipeline in your Azure DevOps project that uses the .pipelines/documentation.yml and run it. Documents and projects folder structure\n\nThe easiest is to work with a mono repository where documentation and code live together. If that's not the case in your situation but you still want to combine multiple repositories into one documentation website, you'll have to clone all repositories first to be able to combine the information. In this recipe we'll assume a monorepo is used. In the steps below we'll consider the generation of the documentation website from this content structure:\n\n{% raw %}\n\nxaml\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 .pipelines             // Azure DevOps pipeline for automatic generation and deployment\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 docs                     // all documents\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 .attachments  // all images and other attachments used by documents\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 infrastructure       // Terraform scripts for creation of the Azure website\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 src                        // all projects\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 build              // build settings\n\u2502          \u251c\u2500\u2500 dotnet     // .NET build settings\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Directory.Build.props   // project settings for all .NET projects in sub folders\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 [Project folders]\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 x-cross\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 toc.yml              // Cross reference definition (optional)\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 .markdownlint.json // Markdownlinter settings\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 docfx.json               // DocFx configuration\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 index.md                 // Website landing page\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 toc.yml                    // Definition of the website header content links\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 web.config              // web.config to enable search in deployed website\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nWe'll be using the DocLinkChecker tool to validate all links in documentation and for orphaned attachments. That's the reason we have all attachments in the .attachments folder. In the generated website from the QuickStart folder you'll see that the hierarchies of documentation and references is combined in the left table of contents. This is achieved by the definition and use of x-cross\\toc.yml. If you don't want the hierarchies combined, just remove the  folder and file from your environment and (re)generate the website. A .markdownlint.json is included with the contents below. The MD013 setting is set to false to prevent checking for maximum line length. You can modify this file to your likings to include or exclude certain tests. {% raw %}\n\njson\n{\n    \"MD013\": false\n}\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nThe contents of the .pipelines and infrastructure folders are explained in the recipe Deploy the DocFx Documentation website to an Azure Website automatically.

        "retrieved_context": "JavaScript/TypeScript Code Reviews\n\nStyle Guide\n\nDevelopers should use prettier to do code formatting for JavaScript. Using an automated code formatting tool like Prettier enforces a well accepted style guide that was collaboratively built by a wide range of companies including Microsoft, Facebook, and AirBnB. For higher level style guidance not covered by prettier, we follow the AirBnB Style Guide. Code Analysis / Linting\n\neslint\n\nPer guidance outlined in Palantir's 2019 TSLint road map,\nTypeScript code should be linted with ESLint. See the typescript-eslint documentation for more information around linting TypeScript code with ESLint. To install and configure linting with ESLint,\ninstall the following packages as dev-dependencies:\n\n{% raw %}\n\nbash\nnpm install -D eslint @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nAdd a .eslintrc.js to the root of your project:\n\n{% raw %}\n\njavascript\nmodule.exports = {\n  root: true,\n  parser: '@typescript-eslint/parser',\n  plugins: [\n    '@typescript-eslint',\n  ],\n  extends: [\n    'eslint:recommended',\n    'plugin:@typescript-eslint/eslint-recommended',\n    'plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended',\n  ],\n};\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nAdd the following to the scripts of your package.json:\n\n{% raw %}\n\njson\n\"scripts\": {\n    \"lint\": \"eslint . --ext .js,.jsx,.ts,.tsx --ignore-path .gitignore\"\n}\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nThis will lint all .js, .jsx, .ts, .tsx files in your project and omit any files or\ndirectories specified in your .gitignore. You can run linting with:\n\n{% raw %}\n\nbash\nnpm run lint\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nSetting up Prettier\n\nPrettier is an opinionated code formatter. Getting started guide. Install with npm as a dev-dependency:\n\n{% raw %}\n\nbash\nnpm install -D prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nAdd prettier to your .eslintrc.js:\n\n{% raw %}\n\njavascript\nmodule.exports = {\n  root: true,\n  parser: '@typescript-eslint/parser',\n  plugins: [\n    '@typescript-eslint',\n  ],\n  extends: [\n    'eslint:recommended',\n    'plugin:@typescript-eslint/eslint-recommended',\n    'plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended',\n    'prettier/@typescript-eslint',\n    'plugin:prettier/recommended',\n  ],\n};\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nThis will apply the prettier rule set when linting with ESLint. Auto formatting with VS Code\n\nVS Code can be configured to automatically perform eslint --fix on save. Create a .vscode folder in the root of your project and add the following to your\n.vscode/settings.json:\n\n{% raw %}\n\njson\n{\n  \"editor.codeActionsOnSave\": {\n    \"source.fixAll.eslint\": true\n  },\n}\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nBy default, we use the following overrides should be added to the VS Code configuration to standardize on single quotes, a four space drop, and to do ESLinting:\n\n{% raw %}\n\njson\n{\n    \"prettier.singleQuote\": true,\n    \"prettier.eslintIntegration\": true,\n    \"prettier.tabWidth\": 4\n}\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nSetting Up Testing\n\nPlaywright is highly recommended to be set up within a project. its an open source testing suite created by Microsoft. To install it use this command:\n\n{% raw %}\n\nbash\nnpm install playwright\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nSince playwright shows the tests in the browser you have to choose which browser you want it to run if unless using chrome, which is the default. You can do this by\n\nBuild Validation\n\nTo automate this process in Azure Devops you can add the following snippet to your pipeline definition yaml file. This will lint any scripts in the ./scripts/ folder. {% raw %}\n\nyaml\n- task: Npm@1\n  displayName: 'Lint'\n  inputs:\n    command: 'custom'\n    customCommand: 'run lint'\n    workingDir: './scripts/'\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nPre-commit hooks\n\nAll developers should run eslint in a pre-commit hook to ensure standard formatting. We highly recommend using an editor integration like vscode-eslint to provide realtime feedback. Under .git/hooks rename pre-commit.sample to pre-commit\n\nRemove the existing sample code in that file\n\nThere are many examples of scripts for this on gist, like pre-commit-eslint\n\nModify accordingly to include TypeScript files (include ts extension and make sure typescript-eslint is set up)\n\nMake the file executable: chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit\n\nAs an alternative husky can be considered to simplify pre-commit hooks.

Moreover, it serves as a short summary of technical expectations before the code-with sprints start. Building a team manifesto at the early phase of engagement, during swarming or preparation phase and keeping it simple without any references or links, and modifying it based on the retrospective results are some useful points about the team manifesto. Creating a team manifesto also starts a conversation during the \"manifesto building session\" (Source: ..\\data\\docs\\code-with-engineering\\agile-development\\advanced-topics\\team-agreements\\team-manifesto.md, chunk59_0).

Completion of this phase of ice-breakers and discussions about the standards takes time, but is required to start increasing the learning curve of the new team. A team manifesto is a light-weight one page agile document among team members which summarizes the basic principles and values of the team and aiming to provide a consensus about technical expectations from each team member in order to deliver high quality output at the end of each engagement. It aims to reduce the time on setting the right expectations without arranging longer \"team document reading\" meetings and provide a consensus among team members to answer the question - \"How does the new team develop the software?\" - by covering all engineering fundamentals and excellence topics such as release process, clean coding, testing. Another main goal of writing the manifesto is to start a conversation during the \"manifesto building session\" to detect any differences of opinion around how the team should work. It also serves in the same way when a new team member joins to the team. New joiners can quickly get up to speed on the agreed standards. How to Build a Team Manifesto\n\nIt can be said that the best time to start building it is at the very early phase of the engagement when teams meet with each other for swarming or during the preparation phase.

For a full list of every unit testing framework see the page on\nWikipedia. Frameworks have many features and\nshould be picked based on which feature-set fits best for the particular project. Mock Frameworks\n\nMany projects start with both a unit test framework, and also add a mock framework. While mocking frameworks have their\nuses and sometimes can be a requirement, it should not be something that is added without considering the broader\nimplications and risks associated with heavy usage of mocks. To see if mocking is right for your project, or if a mock-free approach is more appropriate, see the page on mocking. Tools\n\nThese tools allow for constant running of your unit tests with in-line code coverage, making the dev inner loop\nextremely fast and allows for easy TDD:\n\nVisual Studio Live Unit Testing\n\nWallaby.js\n\nInfinitest for Java\n\nPyCrunch for Python\n\nThings to consider\n\nTransferring responsibility to integration tests\n\nIn some situations it is worth considering to include the integration tests in the inner development loop to provide a sufficient code coverage to ensure the system is working properly. The prerequisite for this approach to be successful is to have integration tests being able to execute at a speed comparable to that of unit tests both locally and in a CI environment. Modern application frameworks like .NET or Spring Boot combined with the right mocking or stubbing approach for external dependencies offer excellent capabilities to enable such scenarios for testing. Usually, integration tests only prove that independently developed modules connect together as designed. The test coverage of integration tests can be extended to verify the correct behavior of the system as well. The responsibility of providing a sufficient branch and line code coverage can be transferred from unit tests to integration tests. Instead of several unit tests needed to test a specific case of functionality of the system, one integration scenario is created that covers the entire flow. For example in case of an API, the received HTTP responses and their content are verified for each request in test. This covers both the integration between components of the API and the correctness of its business logic. With this approach efficient integration tests can be treated as an extension of unit testing, taking over the responsibility of validating happy/failure path scenarios. It has the advantage of testing the system as a black box without any knowledge of its internals. Code refactoring has no impact on tests. Common testing techniques as TDD can be applied at a higher level which results in a development process that is driven by acceptance tests. Depending on the project specifics unit tests still play an important role. They can be used to help dictate a testable design at a lower level or to test complex business logic and corner cases if necessary. Conclusion\n\nUnit testing is extremely important, but it is also not the silver bullet; having proper unit tests is just a part of a\nwell-tested system. However, writing proper unit tests will help with the design of your system as well as help catch\nregressions, bugs, and increase developer velocity. Resources\n\nUnit Testing Best Practices",

We highlight several alternatives for Trusted Research Environments:\n\nSolution Notes Azure Trusted Research Environment An Open Source TRE for Azure. Aridhia DRE\n\nEyes-off machine learning\n\nIn certain situations, Data Scientists may need to train models on data they are not allowed to see. In these cases, an \"eyes-off\" approach is recommended. An eyes-off approach provides a data scientist with an environment in which scripts can be run on the data but direct access to samples is not allowed. When using Azure ML, tools such as the Identity Based Data Access can enable this scenario,\nalongside proper role assignment for users. During the processing within the eyes-off environment, only certain outputs (e.g. logs) are allowed to be extracted back to the user. For example, a user would be able to submit a script which trains a model and inspect the model's performance, but would not be able to see on which samples the model predicted the wrong output. In addition to the eyes-off environment, this approach usually entails providing access to an \"eyes-on\" dataset, which is a representative, cleansed, sample set of data for model design purposes. The Eyes-on dataset is often a de-identified subset of the private dataset, or a synthetic dataset generated based on the characteristics of the private dataset. Private data sharing platforms\n\nVarious tools and systems allow different parties to share data with 3rd parties while protecting private entities, and securely process data while reducing the likelihood of data exfiltration. These tools include Secure Multi Party Computation (SMPC) systems,\nHomomorphic Encryption systems, Confidential Computing,\nprivate data analysis frameworks such as PySift among others. Privacy preserving data pipelines and ML\n\nEven when our data is secure, private entities can still be extracted when the data is consumed. Privacy preserving data pipelines and ML models focus on minimizing the risk of private data exfiltration during data querying or model predictions. Differential Privacy\n\nDifferential privacy (DP) is a system that enables one to extract meaningful insights from datasets about subgroups of people, while also providing strong guarantees with regards to protecting any given individual's privacy. This is typically achieved by adding a small statistical noise to every individual's information,\nthereby introducing uncertainty in the data.",

Once private endpoints are enabled for the Azure Storage accounts, the current tests will fail when executed locally or as part of a pipeline because this connection will be blocked. Utilize an Azure Storage emulator - Azurite\n\nTo emulate a local Azure Blob Storage, we can use Azure Storage Emulator. The Storage Emulator currently runs only on Windows. If you need a Storage Emulator for Linux, one option is the community maintained, open-source Storage Emulator Azurite. The Azure Storage Emulator is no longer being actively developed. Azurite is the Storage Emulator platform going forward. Azurite supersedes the Azure Storage Emulator. Azurite will continue to be updated to support the latest versions of Azure Storage APIs. For more information, see Use the Azurite emulator for local Azure Storage development. Some differences in functionality exist between the Storage Emulator and Azure storage services. For more information about these differences, see the Differences between the Storage Emulator and Azure Storage. There are several ways to install and run Azurite on your local system as listed here. In this document we will cover Install and run Azurite using NPM and Install and run the Azurite Docker image. 1. Install and run Azurite\n\na. Using NPM\n\nIn order to run Azurite V3 you need Node.js >= 8.0 installed on your system. Azurite works cross-platform on Windows, Linux, and OS X. After the Node.js installation, you can install Azurite simply with npm which is the Node.js package management tool included with every Node.js installation. {% raw %}\n\n```bash\n\nInstall Azurite\n\nnpm install -g azurite\n\nCreate azurite directory\n\nmkdir c:/azurite\n\nLaunch Azurite for Windows\n\nazurite --silent --location c:\\azurite --debug c:\\azurite\\debug.log\n```\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nIf you want to avoid any disk persistence and destroy the test data when the Azurite process terminates, you can pass the --inMemoryPersistence option, as of Azurite 3.28.0. The output will be:\n\n{% raw %}\n\nshell\nAzurite Blob service is starting at http://127.0.0.1:10000\nAzurite Blob service is successfully listening at http://127.0.0.1:10000\nAzurite Queue service is starting at http://127.0.0.1:10001\nAzurite Queue service is successfully listening at http://127.0.0.1:10001\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nb. Using a docker image\n\nAnother way to run Azurite is using docker, using default HTTP endpoint\n\n{% raw %}\n\nbash\ndocker run -p 10000:10000 mcr.microsoft.com/azure-storage/azurite azurite-blob --blobHost 0.0.0.0\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nDocker Compose is another option and can run the same docker image using the docker-compose.yml file below. {% raw %}\n\nyaml\nversion: '3.4'\nservices:\n  azurite:\n    image: mcr.microsoft.com/azure-storage/azurite\n    hostname: azurite\n    volumes:\n      - ./cert/azurite:/data\n    command: \"azurite-blob --blobHost 0.0.0.0 -l /data --cert /data/127.0.0.1.pem --key /data/127.0.0.1-key.pem --oauth basic\"\n    ports:\n      - \"10000:10000\"\n      - \"10001:10001\"\n\n{% endraw %}\n\n2. Run tests on your local machine\n\nPython 3.8.7 is used for this, but it should be fine on other 3.x versions as well. Install and run Azurite for local tests:\n\nOption 1: using npm:\n\n{% raw %}\n\nbash\n   # Install Azurite\n   npm install -g azurite\n   # Create azurite directory\n   mkdir c:/azurite\n   # Launch Azurite for Windows\n   azurite --silent --location c:\\azurite --debug c:\\azurite\\debug.log\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nOption 2: using docker\n\n{% raw %}\n\nbash\n   docker run -p 10000:10000 mcr.microsoft.com/azure-storage/azurite azurite-blob --blobHost 0.0.0.0\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nIn Azure Storage Explorer, select Attach to a local emulator\n\nProvide a Display name and port number, then your connection will be ready, and you can use Storage Explorer to manage your local blob storage. To test and see how these endpoints are running you can attach your local blob storage to the Azure Storage Explorer.",

In terms of quota management, one approach is to assign dedicated endpoints to individual consumers or groups with similar requirements. The GenAI Gateway should be configured to route traffic to these designated endpoints based on the consumer's identity. Regular assessment and reallocation of quotas may be necessary to maintain optimal balance and effectiveness in resource usage. Another approach is to apply rate limits at the consumer level in the GenAI Gateway, and if a consumer surpasses their limit, the gateway can restrict access to the GenAI resource until the quota is replenished or degrade the consumer experience based on the defined contract with the consumer.

        "retrieved_context": "Code\n\nYou might have heard more than once that you should write self-documenting code. This doesn't mean that you should never comment your code. There are two types of code comments, implementation comments and documentation comments. Implementation comments\n\nThey are used for internal documentation, and are intended for anyone who may need to maintain the code in the future, including your future self. There can be single line and multi-line comments (e.g., C# Comments). Comments are human-readable and not executed, thus ignored by the compiler. So you could potentially add as many as you want. Now, the use of these comments is often considered a code smell. If you need to clarify your code, that may mean the code is too complex. So you should work towards the removal of the clarification by making the code simpler, easier to read, and understand. Still, these comments can be useful to give overviews of the code, or provide additional context information that is not available in the code itself. Examples of useful comments:\n\nSingle line comment in C# that explains why that piece of code is there (from a private method in System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer):\n\n{% raw %}\n\ncsharp\n// For performance, avoid obtaining actual byte count unless memory usage is higher than the threshold. Span<byte> utf8 = json.Length <= (ArrayPoolMaxSizeBeforeUsingNormalAlloc / JsonConstants.MaxExpansionFactorWhileTranscoding) ? ... {% endraw %}\n\nMulti-line comment in C# that provides additional context (from a private method in System.Text.Json.Utf8JsonReader):\n\n{% raw %}\n\n```csharp\n// Transcoding from UTF-16 to UTF-8 will change the length by somewhere between 1x and 3x. // Un-escaping the token value will at most shrink its length by 6x. // There is no point incurring the transcoding/un-escaping/comparing cost if:\n// - The token value is smaller than charTextLength\n// - The token value needs to be transcoded AND unescaped and it is more than 6x larger than charTextLength\n//      - For an ASCII UTF-16 characters, transcoding = 1x, escaping = 6x => 6x factor\n//      - For non-ASCII UTF-16 characters within the BMP, transcoding = 2-3x, but they are represented as a single escaped hex value, \\uXXXX => 6x factor\n//      - For non-ASCII UTF-16 characters outside of the BMP, transcoding = 4x, but the surrogate pair (2 characters) are represented by 16 bytes \\uXXXX\\uXXXX => 6x factor\n// - The token value needs to be transcoded, but NOT escaped and it is more than 3x larger than charTextLength\n//      - For an ASCII UTF-16 characters, transcoding = 1x,\n//      - For non-ASCII UTF-16 characters within the BMP, transcoding = 2-3x,\n//      - For non-ASCII UTF-16 characters outside of the BMP, transcoding = 2x, (surrogate pairs - 2 characters transcode to 4 UTF-8 bytes)\n\nif (sourceLength < charTextLength\n    || sourceLength / (_stringHasEscaping ?

Overview\n\nAI-enabled object detection and tracking is a powerful solution that utilizes object detection models such as YOLO, RCNN, FastRCNN or FasterRCNN, combined with OpenCV-based object tracking algorithms. This approach enables real-time detection and tracking of objects of interest in a video feed, making it an ideal solution for a variety of applications. While traditional machine learning models require significant amounts of expertise to build, there are several platforms available that can simplify the process. These include Azure AutoML for images, Custom Vision, or Custom Object Detection Models. One of the most common scenarios for AI-enabled object detection and tracking is people counting in real-time. This application is useful in a variety of settings, including retail stores, airports, and public spaces. By detecting and tracking individuals as they move through a space, businesses and organizations can gain valuable insights into foot traffic patterns and make informed decisions about staffing, product placement, and more. In addition to people counting, object detection and tracking can also be used to track vehicles, machinery, materials, and other objects on a shop floor or in a production environment. Another key application of AI-enabled object detection and tracking is safety and security monitoring. By detecting and tracking objects in real-time, businesses can quickly identify potential safety or security breaches and take immediate action to prevent accidents, theft, or other incidents. This technology can also be used to detect defects in a production line, which can help companies identify quality control issues and improve product consistency. Finally, AI-enabled object detection and tracking can be used to manage traffic, such as in smart city applications, by detecting and tracking vehicles in real-time and optimizing traffic flow to reduce congestion and improve safety. This solution supports some common scenarios:\n\nCounting people in real-time\n\nTracking objects, such as cars, machinery, materials on the shop-floor\n\nDetecting safety or security breaches\n\nDetecting defects in a production line\n\nManaging traffic. The Technical Solution in a Nutshell\n\nIn its simplest form, the solution involves the artifacts depicted below:\n\nIts components are:\n\nA camera, running on the user's premises, produces a video stream, usually using rtsp or rtmp protocol\n\nThat video stream is sent through to an AI model to detect a specific object (for instance, persons, or some other moving objects)\n\nFurther processing is performed on the detected objects (for instance: counting the number of people, or obfuscating the detected image for privacy, or detecting an unsafe situation)\n\nThe original video plus the result of AI and further processing are merged and sent to another video stream. Both the original and the processed video-streams are then available for viewing in real-time. Challenges\n\nOne challenge that the Real Time Object Detection and Tracking on the Edge solution helps address is the need for real-time detection and tracking of objects in a video feed. Traditional machine learning models can be time-consuming to develop, making it difficult to achieve real-time results. However, this solution utilizes object detection models like YOLO, RCNN, FastRCNN, or FasterRCNN, combined with OpenCV-based object tracking algorithms, to enable real-time object detection and tracking on the edge. By detecting and tracking objects in real-time, businesses can gain valuable insights and take immediate action to prevent accidents, theft, or other incidents. Another challenge that this solution helps address is the need for automated people counting in real-time.

The solution offers the ability to obfuscate the detected image for privacy while still providing real-time object detection and tracking. This ensures that the privacy of individuals captured on the video feed is protected while still providing businesses with valuable data to optimize their operations. Deployment on the Edge\n\nMost of the time, processing needs to be done on a compute closer to action. The AI model needs to run as often as every 300~400ms - and it is impractical to serve the model in the cloud. The video stream needs to be available on-premise, closer to action. For those reasons, this solution is ofter deployed \"on the edge\", i.e. on a compute that lives outside the cloud. Edge MLOps\n\nA series of containers must be deployed to the edge to make up this solution:\n\nA video streaming solution - that relays the original video stream to one or more formats\n\nOne or more AI \"enrichers\" - that collects the original stream, pipes it through the model, processes it further and relays it to the streaming solution\n\nOne or more AI models - these can be open source models, or custom models produced with Azure ML, or other solutions such as Azure Custom Vision\n\nA Video Player - a front-end solution that can be used to visualize the produced streams. We follow similar pattern defined for MLOps for Edge to generate, package, and deploying those containers to the one or more edge devices. A Sample Repo\n\nThe github repository Video Broker solution demonstrates how to deploy the building blocks of a solution to Detect and Track people. It is deployed in an automated fashion to your Azure Account.",

        "retrieved_context": "Dev Containers: Going further\n\nDev Containers allow developers to share a common working environment, ensuring that the runtime and all dependencies versions are consistent for all developers. Dev containers also allow us to:\n\nLeverage existing tools to enhance the Dev Containers with more features,\n\nProvide custom tools (such as scripts) for other developers. Existing tools\n\nIn the development phase, you will most probably need to use tools not installed by default in your Dev Container. For instance, if your project's target is to be deployed on Azure, you will need Azure-cli and maybe Terraform for resources and application deployment. You can find such Dev Containers in the VS Code dev container gallery repo. Some other tools may be:\n\nLinters for markdown files,\n\nLinters for bash scripts,\n\nEtc... Linting files that are not the source code can ensure a common format with common rules for each developer. These checks should be also run in a Continuous Integration Pipeline, but it is a good practice to run them prior opening a Pull Request. Limitation of custom tools\n\nIf you decide to include Azure-cli in your Dev Container, developers will be able to run commands against their tenant. However, to make the developers' lives easier, we could go further by letting them prefill their connection information, such as the tenant ID and the subscription ID in a secure and persistent way (do not forget that your Dev Container, being a Docker container, might get deleted, or the image could be rebuilt, hence, all customization inside will be lost). One way to achieve this is to leverage environment variables, with untracked .env file part of the solution being injected in the Dev Container. Consider the following files structure:\n\n{% raw %}\n\nbash\nMy Application  # main repo directory\n\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500.devcontainer\n|       \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500Dockerfile\n|       \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500devcontainer.json\n\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500config\n|       \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500.env\n|       \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500.env-sample\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nThe file config/.env-sample is a tracked file where anyone can find environment variables to set (with no values, obviously):\n\n{% raw %}\n\nbash\nTENANT_ID=\nSUBSCRIPTION_ID=\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nThen, each developer who clones the repository can create the file config/.env and fills it in with the appropriate values. In order now to inject the .env file into the container, you can update the file devcontainer.json with the following:\n\n{% raw %}\n\njson\n{\n    ... \"runArgs\": [\"--env-file\",\"config/.env\"],\n    ... }\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nAs soon as the Dev Container is started, these environment variables are sent to the container. Another approach would be to use Docker Compose, a little bit more complex, and probably too much for just environment variables. Using Docker Compose can unlock other settings such as custom dns, ports forwarding or multiple containers. To achieve this, you need to add a file .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml with the following:\n\n{% raw %}\n\nyaml\nversion: '3'\nservices:\n  my-workspace:\n    env_file: ../config/.env\n    build:\n      context: . dockerfile: Dockerfile\n    command: sleep infinity\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nTo use the docker-compose.yml file instead of Dockerfile, we need to adjust devcontainer.json with:\n\n{% raw %}\n\njson\n{\n    \"name\": \"My Application\",\n    \"dockerComposeFile\": [\"docker-compose.yml\"],\n    \"service\": \"my-workspace\"\n    ... }\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nThis approach can be applied for many other tools by preparing what would be required.",

        "retrieved_context": "Markdown Code Reviews\n\nStyle Guide\n\nDevelopers should treat documentation like other source code and follow the same rules and checklists when reviewing documentation as code. Documentation should both use good Markdown syntax to ensure it's properly parsed, and follow good writing style guidelines to ensure the document is easy to read and understand. Markdown\n\nMarkdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world\u2019s most popular markup languages. Using Markdown is different from using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn\u2019t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different. You can find more information and full documentation here. Linters\n\nMarkdown has specific way of being formatted. It is important to respect this formatting, otherwise some interpreters which are strict won't properly display the document. Linters are often used to help developers properly create documents by both verifying proper Markdown syntax, grammar and proper English language. A good setup includes a markdown linter used during editing and PR build verification, and a grammar linter used while editing the document. The following are a list of linters that could be used in this setup. markdownlint\n\nmarkdownlint is a linter for markdown that verifies Markdown syntax, and also enforces rules that make the text more readable. Markdownlint-cli is an easy-to-use CLI based on Markdownlint. It's available as a ruby gem, an npm package, a Node.js CLI and a VS Code extension. The VS Code extension Prettier also catches all markdownlint errors.

        "retrieved_context": "Dev Containers: Going further\n\nDev Containers allow developers to share a common working environment, ensuring that the runtime and all dependencies versions are consistent for all developers. Dev containers also allow us to:\n\nLeverage existing tools to enhance the Dev Containers with more features,\n\nProvide custom tools (such as scripts) for other developers. Existing tools\n\nIn the development phase, you will most probably need to use tools not installed by default in your Dev Container. For instance, if your project's target is to be deployed on Azure, you will need Azure-cli and maybe Terraform for resources and application deployment. You can find such Dev Containers in the VS Code dev container gallery repo. Some other tools may be:\n\nLinters for markdown files,\n\nLinters for bash scripts,\n\nEtc... Linting files that are not the source code can ensure a common format with common rules for each developer. These checks should be also run in a Continuous Integration Pipeline, but it is a good practice to run them prior opening a Pull Request. Limitation of custom tools\n\nIf you decide to include Azure-cli in your Dev Container, developers will be able to run commands against their tenant. However, to make the developers' lives easier, we could go further by letting them prefill their connection information, such as the tenant ID and the subscription ID in a secure and persistent way (do not forget that your Dev Container, being a Docker container, might get deleted, or the image could be rebuilt, hence, all customization inside will be lost). One way to achieve this is to leverage environment variables, with untracked .env file part of the solution being injected in the Dev Container. Consider the following files structure:\n\n{% raw %}\n\nbash\nMy Application  # main repo directory\n\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500.devcontainer\n|       \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500Dockerfile\n|       \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500devcontainer.json\n\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500config\n|       \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500.env\n|       \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500.env-sample\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nThe file config/.env-sample is a tracked file where anyone can find environment variables to set (with no values, obviously):\n\n{% raw %}\n\nbash\nTENANT_ID=\nSUBSCRIPTION_ID=\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nThen, each developer who clones the repository can create the file config/.env and fills it in with the appropriate values. In order now to inject the .env file into the container, you can update the file devcontainer.json with the following:\n\n{% raw %}\n\njson\n{\n    ... \"runArgs\": [\"--env-file\",\"config/.env\"],\n    ... }\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nAs soon as the Dev Container is started, these environment variables are sent to the container. Another approach would be to use Docker Compose, a little bit more complex, and probably too much for just environment variables. Using Docker Compose can unlock other settings such as custom dns, ports forwarding or multiple containers. To achieve this, you need to add a file .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml with the following:\n\n{% raw %}\n\nyaml\nversion: '3'\nservices:\n  my-workspace:\n    env_file: ../config/.env\n    build:\n      context: . dockerfile: Dockerfile\n    command: sleep infinity\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nTo use the docker-compose.yml file instead of Dockerfile, we need to adjust devcontainer.json with:\n\n{% raw %}\n\njson\n{\n    \"name\": \"My Application\",\n    \"dockerComposeFile\": [\"docker-compose.yml\"],\n    \"service\": \"my-workspace\"\n    ... }\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nThis approach can be applied for many other tools by preparing what would be required.",

This application can deploy any provided bundle as\nSimulated Bundle Applications by exposing an HTTP POST endpoint. Flow and interaction between Client Application, Simulator Orchestrator, Simulation Environment and Simulated Bundles:\n\nClient Application can request Simulator Orchestrator to start the simulation of a provided bundle from Bundle Registry. Simulator Orchestrator will deploy bundle with Helper application to Simulation Environment as Simulated Bundle Application. When deployed, Simulated Bundle Application will do testing of the bundle and will report results back to Simulator Orchestrator. It can be done via HTTP Requests, ServiceBus Messages or with direct access to the database. For that, Managed Identity might be added to the Helper Application. Simulator Orchestrator calls the Simulation Environment to get CPU/Memory Metrics of the deployed bundle. After the simulation is done\u00b9, results and metrics are collected and saved, Simulator Orchestrator will stop and delete Simulated Bundle Application. Client Applications can get results from Simulator Orchestrator. \u00b9 all API endpoints will have specified timeouts, to ensure the simulations finish. Simulated Bundle Application\n\nFor running bundles on a simulated environment we will use a sidecar pattern, i.e. multi-container application with two applications inside:\n\nBundle application\n\nHelper application to test bundle API\n\nTwo applications are running together and can communicate via 'localhost'. The diagram below shows this flow:\n\nKubernetes approach\n\nSimulator Orchestrator is an application running on AKS cluster and this application can connect to Kubernetes API. Simulation Environment is AKS Cluster. Simulated Bundle Application is a multi-container pod. AKS Security\n\nThe recommended approach to connect to Kubernetes API from within a pod is using official Client Libraries. Kubernetes C# Client allows to connect to Kubernetes API from within a pod using code:\n\ncsharp\nvar client = new Kubernetes(KubernetesClientConfiguration.InClusterConfig());\n\nA Secure connection will be established using the attached Service Account to the pod on which Simulator Orchestrator is running. A separate Service Account should be created to restrict the possibilities of Kubernetes Client. For example, the next Service Account is limited to only any Create pods in a specified namespace, Delete listed pods and Get Metrics of pods:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ServiceAccount\nmetadata:\n  name: cvt-bundle-simulator-service-account\n  namespace: namespace-aa\nautomountServiceAccountToken: false\n\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nkind: Role\nmetadata:\n  namespace: namespace-aa\n  name: cvt-bundle-simulator-role\nrules:\n- apiGroups: [\"metrics.k8s.io\"]\n  resources: [\"pods\"]\n  verbs: [\"get\"]\n- apiGroups: [\"\"]\n  resources: [\"pods\"]\n  verbs: [\"create\"]\n- apiGroups: [\"\"]\n  resources: [\"pods\"]\n  resourceNames: [\"cvt-simulated-bundle-0-pod\", \"cvt-simulated-bundle-1-pod\", \"cvt-simulated-bundle-2-pod\"]\n  verbs: [\"delete\"]\n\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nkind: RoleBinding\nmetadata:\n  name: cvt-bundle-simulator-role-binding\n  namespace: namespace-aa\nsubjects:\n  - kind: ServiceAccount\n    name: cvt-bundle-simulator-service-account\n    namespace: namespace-aa\nroleRef:\n  kind: Role\n  name: cvt-bundle-simulator-role\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\n```\n\nThis approach allows for having a limited number of 'slots' to which Simulator Orchestrator is\nable to deploy Simulated Bundles. The Simulator Orchestrator will not be able to destroy any other resource in AKS cluster.",

        "retrieved_context": "You have clients requesting predictions that do not have the feature values, without a way to inject them into the requests. These features need to be computed in near real-time. A good use case is a real-time recommendation engine where you aggregate streamed events and generate new recommendations on-demand. Feature stores provide a component called an Online Store. The online store contains the latest version of a feature value (often called materialization). The values persist in a low latency data store, ensuring that features are served in near real-time to your model. The feature store abstracts this materialization process. Are many of your features time-dependent? Do your data scientists spend much time handling complex point-in-time joins? Data scientists need to spend time learning how to do point-in-time correct joins. Constructing point-in-time correct data is time-consuming and error-prone. A feature store has built-in point-in-time joining capabilities, abstracting this complexity away from the data scientists. Do your data scientists spend time writing complex queries or code to access the feature data? During feature value retrieval, data scientists must write code to access the data according to the data source of choice. The lack of abstraction can require writing complex queries or spending time writing code that has little direct value to their work. Sometimes, the time is spent debugging infrastructure issues instead of higher value activities like feature engineering/building the ML model itself. Feature stores provide a Serving layer that works as an abstraction away from the infrastructure. Data scientists can minimize the time spent dealing with the infrastructure and specific syntax and focus on the needed features. This layer combines the feature registry and the point-in-time joins, providing a powerful mechanism for data scientists to access data without knowing the underlying infrastructure.

In theory, it would be possible to use any programming language of your personal preference. Whilst this is true on one side, it is also important to consider that not all languages support common LLM libraries and platforms that can significantly simplify and automate development and deployment. It is still possible to implement LLM scenarios using only REST calls, and not the tools and libraries, but choosing to work without them can lead to additional overhead of development additional tools rather than focusing attention on the solution itself. At the time this document is written, Python, Javascript/Typescript, and .NET (C#) are well supported, and Java is starting to receive some attention. Other languages must rely on REST calls. Let\u2019s pick Azure Open AI as an example of a LLM service. The service itself has an API as well as a small number language-specific libraries that provide wrappers around the REST API. At the same time, even basic backend might need to implement the following functionalities:\n\nHistory management, including history summarization, truncation, and database storage. Chaining several requests together to treat the chain as a black box with inputs and outputs. Implement document loaders in different formats and from different sources that can include embeddings, chunking, and connection management. Interact with a vector database to store and retrieve data based on embeddings. Generalize tools to work with various APIs in order to iterate through them and pick the most relevant results. The most popular libraries that can provide the above functionalities with minimal code are LangChain and Semantic Kernel. Both libraries are open source, support a small number of languages and provide several. Let\u2019s look at some benefits in details. Language Support LLMOps allows us to run experiments and evaluate results using code that will be publish into production. Some companies have very strict rules regarding programming languages that can be for production deployments, and what packages and libraries can be used.

Once the test passes you can refactor the code to make it maybe make more sense, but again the logic\nshould be simple.

        "retrieved_context": "This creates a hard dependency between the two classes, which can make it particularly hard to test\nin isolation. Dependencies could be things like classes wrapping a REST API, or even something as simple as file access. By injecting the dependencies into our system rather than constructing them, we have \"inverted control\" of the\ndependency. You may see \"Inversion of Control\" and \"Dependency Injection\" used as separate terms, but it is very hard to\nhave one and not the other, with some arguing that Dependency Injection is a more specific way of saying inversion of\ncontrol. In certain languages such as C#, not using\ndependency injection can lead to code that is not unit testable since there is no way to inject mocked objects. Keeping testability in mind from the beginning and evaluating using dependency injection can save you from a time-intensive\nrefactor later. One of the downsides of dependency injection is that\nit can easily go overboard. While there are no longer hard dependencies, there is still coupling between the interfaces,\nand passing around every interface implementation into every class presents just as many downsides as not using\nDependency Injection. Being intentional with what dependencies get injected to what classes, is key to developing a maintainable\nsystem. Many languages include special Dependency Injection frameworks that take care of the boilerplate code and construction\nof the objects. Examples of this are Spring in Java or built into ASP.NET Core\n\nAn example of using dependency injection can be found here. Test-Driven Development\n\nTest-Driven Development (TDD) is less a technique in how your code is designed, but a technique for writing your\ncode that will lead you to a testable design from the start. The basic premise of test-driven development is that you\nwrite your test code first and then write the system under test to match the test you just wrote. This way all the test\ndesign is done up front and by the time you finish writing your system code, you are already at 100% test pass rate and\ntest coverage. It also guarantees testable design is built into the system since the test was written first! For more information on TDD and an example, see the page on Test-Driven Development\n\nBest Practices\n\nArrange/Act/Assert\n\nOne common form of organizing your unit test code is called Arrange/Act/Assert. This divides up your unit test into 3\ndifferent discrete sections:\n\nArrange - Set up all the variables, mocks, interfaces, and state you will need to run the test\n\nAct - Run the system under test, passing in any of the above objects that were created\n\nAssert - Check that with the given state that the system acted appropriately. Using this pattern to write tests makes them very readable and also familiar to future developers who would need to read\nyour unit tests.",

The degree to which a synthetic dataset is an accurate proxy for real data is a measure of utility. The potential benefit of such synthetic datasets is for sensitive applications \u2013 medical classifications or financial modelling, where getting hands on a high-quality labelled dataset is often prohibitive. When determining the best method for creating synthetic data, it is essential first to consider what type of synthetic data you aim to have. There are two broad categories to choose from, each with different benefits and drawbacks:\n\nFully synthetic: This data does not contain any original data, which means that re-identification of any single unit is almost impossible, and all variables are still fully available. Partially synthetic: Only sensitive data is replaced with synthetic data, which requires a heavy dependency on the imputation model. This leads to decreased model dependence but does mean that some disclosure is possible due to the actual values within the dataset.

        "retrieved_context": "Mocks\n\nFowler describes mocks as pre-programmed objects with expectations which form a specification of the calls they are\nexpected to receive. In other words, mocks are a replacement object for the dependency that has certain expectations\nthat are placed on it; those expectations might be things like validating a sub-method has been called a certain number\nof times or that arguments are passed down in a certain way. Mocking frameworks are abundant for every language, with some languages having mocks built into the unit test packages. They make writing unit tests easy and still encourage good unit testing practices. The main difference between a mock and most of the other test doubles is that mocks do behavioral verification,\nwhereas other test doubles do state verification. With behavioral verification, you end up testing that the\nimplementation of the system under test is as you expect, whereas with state verification the implementation is not\ntested, rather the inputs and the outputs to the system are validated. The major downside to behavioral verification is that it is tied to the implementation. One of the biggest advantages of\nwriting unit tests is that when you make code changes you have confidence that if your unit tests continue to pass, that\nyou are making a relatively safe change. If tests need to be updated every time because the behavior of the method has\nchanged, then you lose that confidence because bugs could also be introduced into the test code. This also increases the\ndevelopment time and can be a source of frustration. For example, let's assume you have a method that you are testing that makes 5 web service calls. With mocks, one of your\ntests could be to check that those 5 web service calls were made. Sometime later the API is updated and only a single\nweb service call needs to be made. Once the system code is changed, the unit test will fail because it expects 5 calls\nand not 1. The test needs to be updated, which results in lowered confidence in the change, as well as potentially\nintroduces more areas for bugs to sneak in. Some would argue that in the example above, the unit test is not a good test anyway because it depends on the\nimplementation, and that may be true; but one of the biggest problems with using mocks (and specifically mocking\nframeworks that allow these verifications), is that it encourages these types of tests to be written. By not using a\nmock framework that allows this, you never run the risk of writing tests that are validating the implementation. Upsides to Mocking\n\nEasy to write. Encourages testable design. Downsides to Mocking\n\nBehavioral testing can present problems with maintainability in unit test code. Usually requires a framework to be installed (or if no framework, lots of boilerplate code)\n\nFakes\n\nFake objects actually have working implementations, but usually take some shortcut which may make them not suitable\nfor production. One of the common examples of using a Fake is an in-memory database - typically you want your database\nto be able to save data somewhere between application runs, but when writing unit tests if you have a fake implementation of\nyour database APIs that are store all data in memory, you can use these for unit tests and not break abstraction as well\nas still keep your tests fast. Writing a fake does take more time than other test doubles, because they are full implementations, and can have\ntheir own suite of unit tests. In this sense though, they increase confidence in your code even more because your test\ndouble has been thoroughly tested for bugs before you even use it as a downstream dependency. Similarly to mocks, fakes also promote testable design, but unlike mocks they do not require any frameworks to write. Writing a fake is as easy as writing any other implementation class. Fakes can be included in the test code only, but\nmany times they end up being \"promoted\" to the product code, and in some cases can even start off in the product code\nsince it is held to the same standard with full unit tests. Especially if writing a library or an API that other\ndevelopers can use, providing a fake in the product code means those developers no longer need to write their own mock\nimplementations, further increasing re-usability of code. Upsides to Fakes\n\nNo framework needed, is just like any other implementation. Encourages testable design. Code can be \"promoted\" to product code, so it is not wasted effort. Downsides to Fakes\n\nTakes more time to implement. Best Practices\n\nTo keep your mocking efficient, consider these best practices to make your code testable, save time and make your\ntest assertions more meaningful. Dependency Injection\n\nIf you don\u2019t keep testability in mind from the beginning, once you start writing your tests, you might realize you have\nto do a time-intensive refactor to make the code unit testable. A common problem that can lead to non-testable code in certain\nlanguages such as C# is not using dependency injection. Consider using dependency injection so that a mock can easily be injected\ninto your Subject Under Test (SUT) during a unit test. More information on using dependency injection can be found here. Assertions\n\nWhen it comes to assertions in unit tests you want to make sure that you assert the right things, not necessarily lots\nof things. Some assertions can be inefficient and not give you the confidence you need in the test result. When you are\nmocking a client or configuration and your method passes the mock result directly as a return value without significant\nchanges, consider not asserting on the return value. Because if you do, you are mainly asserting whether you set up the\nmock correctly. For a very simple example, look at this class:\n\n{% raw %}\n\n```csharp\n\npublic class SearchController : ControllerBase {\n\npublic ISearchClient SearchClient { get; }\n\npublic SearchController(ISearchClient searchClient)\n   {\n      SearchClient = searchClient;\n   }\n\npublic String GetName(string id)\n   {\n      return this.SearchClient.GetName(id);\n   }\n}\n```\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nWhen testing the GetName method, you can set up a mock search client to return a certain value. Then, it\u2019s easy to\nassert that the return value is, in fact, this value from the mock. {% raw %}\n\ncsharp\nmockSearchClient.Setup(x => x.GetName(id))\n   .ReturnsAsync(\"myResult\");\nvar result = searchController.GetName(id);\nAssert.Equal(\"myResult\",result.Value);\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nBut now, your method could look like this, and the test would still pass:\n\n{% raw %}\n\ncsharp\npublic String GetName(string id)\n{\n   return \"myResult\";\n}\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nSimilarly, if you set up your mock wrong, the test would fail even though the logic inside the method is sound. For efficient\nassertions that will give you confidence in your SUT, make assertions on your logic, not mock return values.",

Why Synthetic Monitoring tests\n\nTraditionally, software providers rely on testing through CI/CD stages in the well known testing pyramid (unit, integration, e2e) to validate that the product is healthy and without regressions. Such tests will run on the build agent or in the test/stage environment before being deployed to production and released to live user traffic. During the services' lifetime in the production environment, they are safeguarded by monitoring and alerting tools that rely on Real User Metrics/Monitoring (RUM). However, as more organizations today provide highly-available (99.9+ SLA) products, they find that the nature of long-lived distributed applications, which typically rely on several hardware and software components, is to fail. Frequent releases (sometimes multiple times per day) of various components of the system can create further instability. This rapid rate of change to the production environment tends to make testing during CI/CD stages not hermetic and actually not representative of the end user experience and how the production system actually behaves. For such systems, the ambition of service engineering teams is to reduce to a minimum the time it takes to fix errors, or the MTTR - Mean Time To Repair. It is a continuous effort, performed on the live/production system. Synthetic Monitors can be used to detect the following issues:\n\nAvailability - Is the system or specific region available. Transactions and customer journeys - Known good requests should work, while known bad requests should error.",

        "retrieved_context": "No other changes would be required. Learnings and important elements regarding the GigeVision/GenICam cameras\n\nThis section aims to collect learnings and important elements regarding the GigeVision/GenICam cameras used in CVT. This is a collection of dos and don'ts and processes to improve the reliability of the cameras used in the production line. Do\n\nAs explained in the CVT deployment typology, cameras *must- be connected in the same network as the IPC/VM they are attached to. Cameras *must- be connected directly to the IPC/VM without any proxy or firewall opening and checking the packets. Cameras streaming ports *must- be different for each camera. A large enough range of ports should be available for this. It is technically possible to use any port for this purpose. For maintenance, make sure you disconnect the cameras from the network first and *then- connect to it with the vendor tools. Don't\n\nDuring the camera setup, if you are using a configuration application from the camera vendor, *DO NOT- configure them in the network where they are supposed to be attached. If you do this, it will stream and saturate the network during the configuration. First setup the camera in an independent network, not connected to the final network. Once ready, change the camera IP address for the final IP address. *Never update the camera when it is connected to the network. See the point on dofor the maintenance. The camera has to be disconnected first from the network, then connected directly to a PC and finally, the update process can be done. Self fixing solution in code\n\nCameras like any other elements can become unstable. This can be the case when multiple network errors occur during its usage, when a connection is not properly closed. If the camera starts to timeout on a regular basis (it depends on the camera), but lets say 3 times in a row, you should reboot the camera. To reboot a camera, for most cameras, a command is available, usually named DeviceReset, the reset value is 1. So when you use this command, the camera will proceed to a reboot. This is taking a couple of milliseconds. Refer to the vendor manual to understand long much you need to wait. Once rebooted, most cameras need a warmup phase. In short, it consist of taking multiple pictures (this depends of the vendor and camera type) before being able to have a proper image. The typical time found so far is to take 20 to 30 pictures which is the equivalent of a few seconds. This is mainly due to the auto brightness that is setup in most cameras. Adjusting settings on the fly\n\nMost cameras do support to adjust some settings on the fly. It can be the resolution, the brightness, the color scheme, the image format. While some of them won't need a warm up (changing the pixel format or the resolution for example on all cameras tested so far), some will require as well a warmup like when it is rebooted. The only way to understand this is to test for each cameras and adjust this. Note that it is not really recommended to change those settings on the fly related to the sensitivity of controlling those cameras. It seems more efficient to have a second camera with different settings if needed. Network collisions and camera streams\n\nThe protocol used to stream the pictures is using UDP and is optimize to consume *all- the available bandwidth and output as many images as possible. So it is clearly not recommended to let the cameras stream but rather take individual pictures when supported by the cameras and stop the streaming as soon as the number of pictures required is achieved. This does means as well that the number of cameras that can be connected in the same network and taking the pictures should be properly orchestrated. With a small number of cameras, it seems reasonable not to have a deep control but with few of those, you may have to orchestrate taking the pictures with a small delay between each of them to avoid any incident in the network. There is as well a way for most cameras to setup a number of frames per seconds. By setting a smaller number of images per second, we can decrease the network spamming. This will result in a better network manageability. Now, most camera brands have a different way to set this up. so the code will have to handle the brand used. This will have the inconvenient to make receiving an image in case the image is partial and need another one a bit slower than with the maximum number of images per second.

The bot was designed for origination of of general insurance for a pan-geo digital native insurer. The bot consisted of a multi-turn (~25 turns) directed conversation orchestrated and implemented via the prompting of GPT-4 with various structured DSLs emitted to the output to be further processed by downstream channels (Facebook messenger, WhatsApp etc...). While the bot was \"functional\" in sofar as it could complete a full transactional conversation, the per-turn latency was at such a level that it was not able to be deployed to customers. Through a series of experiments, we identified key factors that impacted the chatbot\u2019s speed and implemented solutions to address these issues. The goal was to enhance the chatbot\u2019s performance and ensure its readiness for launch. Overview\n\nPrior to engagement the chatbot application would incur latency of between 10s and 30s per chat-turn. The resolution was to re-architect the approach to LLM prompting to use the Azure Open AI Function Calling pattern. This in turn allowed the application to change from using GPT-4 to the GPT 3.5 Turbo model which is significantly faster. As a result, per-turn latency was reduced from 10s-30s down to ~3s. Outline\n\nThe application in question is a multi-turn commerce chatbot for general insurance policy origination. The chatbot is designed to provide information about policy options and collect information, including PII, before providing for quotation and policy purchase. The chatbot is intended to be delivered through a range of chat-like channels, including Line, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and the insurers website. The chatbot is highly interactive, with a typical origination conversation requiring 20-30 chat turns. The application was initially built using complex explicit prompting to execute a step-by-step conversation with the user, with generated output from the LLM model (GPT-4 8k) always returned in pre-defined formatted JSON text. This JSON text was then consumed by downstream channels for presentation to the user. Chat history was included in subsequent prompt turns. The bot is multi-lingual and targets English along with a range of East Asian and Southeast Asian languages including Thai, Malay and Bahasa Indonesia. The problem presented to our team for assistance was that the chatbot was taking upwards of 8 seconds per chat-turn. While the chatbot was fully functional as built, the latency of chat-turns was such that it was not able to go to production. There were also concerns with the exhaustion of the 8k token-limit as other larger use-cases are to be implemented. While not raised with us, we also believe that the bot as implemented would be cost prohibitive to operate at scale. Initial Assessment\n\nAn initial workshop with the user identified a range of potential issues for investigation. Out team members was engaged alongside the user\u2019s engineering team.",

Stage 2: Bootstrap and provision the Edge device to IoT Hub and deploy the IoT Edge modules.

Stage 2 bootstraps the Edge device with the configuration files from Stage 1, and provision it to Azure Cloud. The image below illustrates the stage 2 provisioning architecture.

        "retrieved_context": "Computer Vision Toolkit (CVT)\n\nCVT is a cloud and edge based platform for packaging, deploying and running computer vision, OCR, ML/AI and other types of models within production facilities. The main goal of CVT is to support use cases especially in the area of quality inspection and traceability. By leveraging Azure cloud platforms, CVT offers a scalable computer vision solution potentially enabling 100% inspection rates across multiple factories globally. Business Problem\n\nComputer Vision Toolkit is solving the problem of deploying and running at scale any kind of computer vision, OCR, ML/AI on the edge. When reading at scale, think of lots of hundreds or thousands models in different locations where you can, in a standard way run those regardless with which technology they've been built with. There is also another aspect which is about the deployment of a standard edge solution that can run in a virtual machine in a shared environment or a physical machine, all in the same way. Challenges\n\nThere are multiple challenges to overcome. The first one is to find a good way to standardize running computer vision on the edge with a standard set or interfaces leaving the freedom to anyone to use the best technology for it. And at the same time, you want to make sure that the interfaces are working the way they are supposed to and being able to run security checks. Another challenge is to optimize the hardware and the processes to run this workload on the edge. Thing of a factory where you have a machine producing one part ever 10 minutes, another one with part every minute and a third one once per day. Rather than having to deploy 3 different hardware attached to the machines, you will want to optimize and group everything on a single virtual or physical machine. This is a large cost scenario optimization that in most patterns available is not been taken into consideration. Another important challenge to overcome is the integration with Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) used in the industrial world to control and pilot production machines. Those exposes signal and speaks standards like OPC and OPC-UA. You want to be able to take pictures when a part is ready and instruct back the PLC if the part is a good one or a bad one. Solution\n\nTo solve the first challenge on the standardized way of running computer vision on the edge, the solution is to use a Bundle. To solve the challenge of optimizing the cost and workloads running at the same time, we solve this problem designing a solution that can run multiple computer vision workload, shared on the same machine rather than having to manage multiple machines and maintaining them. The solution works as well when deployed in an on-premise data-center in a Kubernetes style pattern or on an Azure IoT Edge pattern or even with a simple docker compose or any other solution that can deploy and run containers. The solution allows to use at scale industrial GigeVision cameras. Those cameras are standard in the industrial world. The all up solution is designed to integrate in a factory, it is designed to take pictures based on triggers and output the model prediction through OPC-UA. Architecture\n\nWe want to establish a generalized solution approach for computer vision\nprojects. CVT (Computer Vision Toolbox) is supposed to offer this approach by\ncombining the ability to work with pictures and cameras on the shop floor with a\nstandardized cloud-based configuration service and ML templates as well as\ninterfaces that enable the user to easily configure the solution. Bundle\n\nIn short, a bundle is a container containing one or multiple models with a standard interface and metadata. For ease of deployment of Machine Learning models a common way of packaging the models and all related assets must be defined. This will facilitate the generalization of the deployments as well as make it easier for teams to operationalize them.

The data drift components can be injected differently based on the inferencing scenario, for example:\n\nreal-time inferencing for supervised Machine Learning\n\nbatch inferencing for supervised Machine Learning\n\ninferencing for unsupervised Machine Learning scenarios (like clustering)\n\nWe are not evaluating near real-time inferencing scenarios for supervised ML because they are similar to real-time from a data drift operationalization perspective. We will discuss the following questions in this document:\n\nWhat a data drift workload is from an Azure ML technology perspective. How to deploy changes into data drift workloads. How to invoke data drift in an automated way or by request. How to collect the outcome from data drift workload and implement notifications. What the difference is for data drift operationalization between supervised vs unsupervised ML scenarios. Main Deployment Artifact\n\nBecause this document is more about data drift operations rather than about algorithms themselves, we can define a data drift implementation script as the main deployment artifact. While we won't go too deep in details about how it\u2019s implemented, we need to make some assumptions about it:\n\nThe script itself should have access to a training dataset that has been used to train the current model. In the case of unsupervised ML, it can be a baseline dataset that we are holding from a previous algorithm execution or that we used initially to test the selected Machine Learning approach. The script should have access to new data with the ability to group them by timeframes in order to execute the data drift algorithm on a new (most recent batch from previous execution) batch of data. In the case of batch inferencing or for unsupervised algorithms, the inferencing service can update the entire dataset at once, and filtering might be not required. The script requires some computational power that might not be limited to CPU or to a single machine (node/instance) only.",

Features are descriptive attributes about a dataset that help in model prediction, forecasting, and more. Raw data is rarely in a format that can be consumed by an ML model directly, so it needs to be transformed into features. This process is called feature engineering. What is a Feature Store? A Feature Store is a software toolkit designed to manage raw data transformations into features. Feature Stores often include metadata management tools to register, share, and track features. Feature stores also handle the complexity of doing correct point-in-time joins. So, the resulting data frame can be ingested by any model training libraries. The Feature Store Adoption Guide dives deeper into whether a Feature Store is right for your project. The Feature Store Comparison Guide makes comparisons between the popular feature stores to help you pick the best fit for your use case. How Feature Stores simplify the ML Model Workflow? A typical ML Model workflow (for example, without Feature Stores) generally means one has to build multiple models using hundreds of features. The maintenance of the feature transformation pipelines alone becomes tedious, slowing down the productivity and efficiency of model development. Also, the design isn't easily reuseable and doesn't promote sharing of features across teams.",

        "retrieved_context": "LLMs can be used to process large amounts of text and learn the structure and syntax of human language. The development of LLMs has been a gradual process, especially over the past decade. The first LLMs were relatively small and could only perform simple language tasks. However, with the advances in deep neural networks, larger and more powerful LLMs were created. The figure below shows examples of LLMs that have been introduced over the past few years with their sizes. The 2020 release of the GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) model marked a significant milestone in the development of LLMs. GPT-3 also represents a family of models of different sizes. GPT3 demonstrated the ability to generate coherent and convincing text that was difficult to distinguish from text written by humans. Like other foundation models, LLMs such as GPT-3 are trained in a self-supervised/unsupervised manner and can be adapted to perform different tasks and/or applications. This training process is in contrast to traditional machine learning models where different models are trained for different tasks using labeled data. For example, LLMs can be used to generate text for chat-bots, language translation, and content creation. They can also be used to analyze and summarize large amounts of text data, such as news articles or social media posts. In addition, LLMs can be used to write programming code from natural language requests. Adapting the LLMs for different tasks or applications can be done in two ways: in-context learning through prompt engineering or fine-tuning. Regardless of the approach to be used, developers and data scientists should learn about and adopt new techniques.

Determine the overall business problem first and then evaluate if ML can help address a part of the problem space. Few considerations for identifying the right fit for the project:\n\nEngage experts in human experience and employ techniques such as Design Thinking and Problem Formulation to understand the customer needs and human behavior first. Identify the right stakeholders from both business and technical leadership and invite them to these workshops. The outcome should be end-user scenarios and personas to determine the real needs of the users. Focus on System Design principles to identify the architectural components, entities, interfaces, constraints. Ask the right questions early and explore design alternatives with the engineering team. Think hard about the costs of ML and whether we are solving a repetitive problem at scale. Many a times, customer problems can be solved with data analytics, dashboards, or rule-based algorithms as the first phase of the project. Set Expectations for high ambiguity in ML components\n\nML projects can be plagued with a phenomenon we can call as the \"Death by Unknowns\". Unlike software engineering projects, ML focused projects can result in quick success early (aka sudden decrease in error rate), but this may flatten eventually. Few things to consider:\n\nSet clear expectations: Identify the performance metrics and discuss on a \"good enough\" prediction rate that will bring value to the business.

        "retrieved_context": "Best practices and optimising results with Azure Cognitive Search\n\nOverview\n\nInformation Retrieval (IR) systems (or \"search systems\") are systems that help users find their information needs in a collection. Information needs are something in the users' mind and are often represented in the form of queries. Understanding users\u2019 information needs and finding the right information for them requires an intelligent system that is beyond term matching. Azure Cognitive Search is a search-as-a-service cloud solution that gives developers APIs and tools for adding a rich search experience over private, heterogeneous content in web, mobile, and enterprise applications. Your code or a tool invokes data ingestion (indexing) to create and load an index. Optionally, you can add cognitive skills to apply AI processes during indexing. Doing so can add new information and structures useful for search and other scenarios. On the other side of your service, your application code issues query requests and handles responses. The search experience is defined in your client using functionality from Azure Cognitive Search, with query execution over a persisted index that you create, own, and store in your service. Functionality is exposed through a simple REST API or .NET SDK that masks the inherent complexity of information retrieval. In addition to APIs, the Azure portal provides administration and content management support, with tools for prototyping and querying your indexes. Because the service runs in the cloud, infrastructure and availability are managed by Microsoft. Potential Applications\n\nThere are various application scenarios where we can leverage Azure search besides building an enterprise search system to retrieve internal documents. Here are several potential application scenarios:\n\nQuestion-answering system: When we are developing a question answering system, we may consider a multi-stage system where the first stage is built on top of Azure search. For the second stage, we can implement complex natural language processing techniques (e.g. summarization) to generate answers. Systematic review or legal search: These types of retrieval problems are domain-specific, and they are recall-based, which aims to find all relevant documents. Pub/Sub systems: This is a type of search which we refer to as \"document routing\", where users\u2019 queries are often fixed, and documents come in a streaming fashion. In these systems, we may index user queries using Azure search, and route documents to the relevant queries. Geospatial Search: This is a type of search where you can search any items based on their geolocation. You can visualize results with a map. To help this type of search, you have a parameter, \"search area coordinates\", which provides a polygon to search your items on the map. Multi-media Search system: This is a type of search that allows for searching across multi-modal data types, i.e. other than text documents. We can ingest many document types with several data enhancing techniques such as image recognition, image detection, OCR text extraction from images, video transcribing and more. Examples of media search:\n\nImproving Video Search using AI - A full solution that automates the analysis of videos with Azure Video Indexer, creates and improves the search index with Video Indexer insights and optional metadata. Provides a web UI application to search and see results and logs the behavior and feedback of users (in order for the admin or data science team to improve the search index). Lastly it also provides a dashboard which displays statistics on platform usage and search performances. AI Enrichment Pipeline tutorial - Complete sample for processing text, image and video files through a full enrichment pipeline with event grid, service bus, functions, logic apps, cognitive services and video indexer\n\nExtracting and indexing data from forms. Azure Cognitive Search can index content extracted from forms so that they may be searched. Examples of searching data from forms:\n\nMicrosoft Fabric - Create a custom search engine and question-answering system\n\nAzure Cognitive Search from Forms\n\nAzure AI Search (Azure Cognitive Search) Search Types\n\nThere are three main types of searches in Azure AI Search for information retrieval:\n\nKeyword Search (Full-text search): matches plain text between the query and the data stored in the index in Azure AI Search. This search type is recommended when the case requires exact words matching like proper names, numbers, license plates, domain names, phrase etc.",

This approach requires integration tests that can execute at a similar speed to that of unit tests both locally and in a CI environment. Modern application frameworks like .NET or Spring Boot, combined with the right mocking or stubbing approach for external dependencies, offer excellent capabilities to enable such testing scenarios. The responsibility of providing a sufficient branch and line code coverage can be transferred from unit tests to integration tests. In this approach, one integration scenario covers the entire flow instead of several unit tests needed to test a specific case functionality of the system. Integration testing can be treated as an extension of unit testing, taking over the responsibility of validating various scenarios.(Integration Testing Frameworks and Tools, ..\\\\data\\\\docs\\\\code-with-engineering\\\\automated-testing\\\\integration-testing\\\\README.md)",
        "retrieved_context": "Why Unit Tests\n\nIt is no secret that writing unit tests is hard, and even harder to write well. Writing unit tests also increases the\ndevelopment time for every feature. So why should we bother writing them? Reduce costs\n\nThere is no question that the later a bug is found, the more expensive it is to fix; especially so if the bug makes it\ninto production. A 2008 research study by IBM\nestimates that a bug caught in production could cost 6 times as much as if it was caught during implementation. Increase Developer Confidence\n\nMany changes that developers make are not big features or something that requires an entire testing suite. A strong unit\ntest suite helps increase the confidence of the developer that their change is not going to cause any downstream bugs. Having unit tests also helps with making safe, mechanical refactors that are provably safe; using things like\nrefactoring tools to do mechanical refactoring and running unit tests that cover the refactored code should be enough to\nincrease confidence in the commit. Speed up development\n\nUnit tests take time to write, but they also speed up development? While this may seem like an oxymoron, it is one of\nthe strengths of a unit testing suite - over time it continues to grow and evolve until the tests become an essential\npart of the developer workflow. If the only testing available to a developer is a long-running system test, integration tests that require a deployment,\nor manual testing, it will increase the amount of time taken to write a feature. These types of tests should be a part of\nthe \"Outer loop\"; tests that may take some time to run and validate more than just the code you are writing. Usually\nthese types of outer loop tests get run at the PR stage or even later during merges into branches. The Developer Inner Loop is the process that developers go through as they are authoring code. This varies from\ndeveloper to developer and language to language but typically is something like code -> build -> run -> repeat. When\nunit tests are inserted into the inner loop, developers can get early feedback and results from the code they are\nwriting. Since unit tests execute really quickly, running tests shouldn't be seen as a barrier to entry for this loop. Tooling such as Visual Studio Live Unit Testing\nalso help to shorten the inner loop even more. Documentation as code\n\nWriting unit tests is a great way to show how the units of code you are writing are supposed to be used.",

A reason for this is that E2E tests give developers the highest confidence to release as they are testing the \"real\" system. CDC addresses these issues by testing interactions between components in isolation using mocks that conform to a shared understanding documented in a \"contract\". Contracts are agreed between consumer and provider, and are regularly verified against a real instance of the provider component. This effectively partitions a larger system into smaller pieces that can be tested individually in isolation of each other, leading to simpler, fast and stable tests that also give confidence to release. Some E2E tests are still required to verify the system as a whole when deployed in the real environment, but most functional interactions between components can be covered with CDC tests. CDC testing was initially developed for testing RESTful API's, but the pattern scales to all consumer-provider systems and tooling for other messaging protocols besides HTTP does exist. Consumer-driven Contract Testing Design Blocks\n\nIn a consumer-driven approach the consumer drives changes to contracts between a consumer (the client) and a provider (the server). This may sound counterintuitive, but it helps providers create APIs that fit the real requirements of the consumers rather than trying to guess these in advance. Next we describe the CDC building blocks ordered by their occurrence in the development cycle. Consumer Tests with Provider Mock\n\nThe consumers start by creating integration tests against a provider mock and running them as part of their CI pipeline. Expected responses are defined in the provider mock for requests fired from the tests. Through this, the consumer essentially defines the contract they expect the provider to fulfill. Contract\n\nContracts are generated from the expectations defined in the provider mock as a result of a successful test run. CDC frameworks like Pact provide a specification for contracts in json format consisting of the list of request/responses generated from the consumer tests plus some additional metadata. Contracts are not a replacement for a discussion between the consumer and provider team.",

However, based on the information in the context, it is important to avoid any element in the network that will slow down or analyze the traffic generated by high speed UDP based protocols like GigeVision and GenICam, which are used to stream pictures and control the camera. It is also recommended to connect the cameras to the same network as the VM or machine running CVT, and to have a specific network dedicated to those cameras, especially when accessing multiple cameras at the same time (Source: ..\\\\data\\\\docs\\\\code-with-mlops\\\\solutions\\\\ai-on-the-edge\\\\serving-models-on-edge\\\\computer-vision-on-edge\\\\camera-interface.md, chunkId: chunk885_5). Additionally, it is stated that network infrastructure must not filter the UDP protocol on port 3956 as it is used by the GenICam protocol (Source: ..\\\\data\\\\docs\\\\code-with-mlops\\\\solutions\\\\ai-on-the-edge\\\\serving-models-on-edge\\\\computer-vision-on-edge\\\\camera-interface.md, chunkId: chunk886_6).",
        "retrieved_context": "More details in this document. Based on the fact that GigeVision and GenICam protocols used to stream pictures and control the camera are high speed UDP based protocols, it is important to avoid any element in the network that will slow down or analyzes this traffic. Also, the GenICam protocol forces to use the same port on all camera 3956 in UDP to control and pilot the camera settings. The mechanism used for the answer is to generate on the requester side a random port. This mechanism is important especially when accessing multiple cameras at the same time. This is illustrated in the network capture below:\n\nThe streaming mechanism with the GigeVision protocol is different as the requester can properly setup a streaming port. So a range of ports can be selected for this manner. Speed and large traffic is all what is important when GigeVision protocol has been designed. As an example, a Basler camera has a resolution of 2448x2440 and in 8 bits color, the raw image transferred will be: 2448 - 2440 - 8 - 3= 143 354 880 bytes (this is an example, size can vary). Count overhead of about 36 bytes per packet during transfer and to be able to read 1 image you'll stream about 3 of them, you'll quickly saturate a firewall or any element opening and interpreting the packets to route them. So it's *fundamental- to have the cameras in the same network as the VM or the machine running CVT. In the case of physical machine, it is even recommended to have a specific network dedicated to those cameras, see operationalization section below. Operationalization\n\nWhile installing the camera, the same network as the VM/Edge/Kubernetes or the machine has to be used. It is important that the VM will be granted access to the Azure cloud resources. The camera has no need to get any internet access. The key point is to have both VM and associated cameras on the same network without any filtering element between them. In the case of a VM, having all elements in the DMZ is one of the possible scenario\n\nIn the case of a physical machine running the same configuration as in a VM (not standalone but here, a connected scenario like in a VM but on a physical machine), the physical machine will have to have access as well to the Azure cloud resources. It can be in the DMZ or in another network but the could connectivity is a must as well. We expect those scenarios to be very consuming in terms of bandwidth as the main interest is to have a stronger machine being able to compute more elements on a dedicated use case. DMZ is a possible scenario as well for cameras and the physical machine but the network will most likely be used a lot by the cameras. Another possibility is to have the physical machine with 2 network card, one having access to the Azure cloud resources, DMZ network is a possibility. And as in the case of the physical machine, the camera may be close to the machine, it make sense to isolate them in a dedicated network connected to the second network card of the dedicated machine. In the case of CVT Standalone, any network, including fully isolated can be used. That say it may be handy to have the standalone version accessing the Azure cloud resources as well. In all cases during the installation of the camera, it is strongly recommended to use the tools provided by the different vendors. Each vendor has specific settings and will allow a proper configuration. For this, a direct connection between the camera and a laptop is largely enough. Once ready, all camera support a change of their IP address directly from those tools. The camera can then be unplugged from the laptop and plug into the proper destination network. Risks & Mitigation\n\nThe main risks with those GigeVision cameras is a network traffic saturation. They can output 30 raw images per seconds taking 1G of network bandwidth. This is mitigated by the fact we only take 1 image. Now to get 1 image, on some cameras, this requires to gather 2 to 3 images as they don't support single picture mode. So network separation needs to be done in a good way to allow a set of cameras and other equipments like a VM to properly operate together. There may be need of more network separation or having few dedicated hardware where camera do connect directly and acting like a gateway. This will technically look like the current Camera Interface (the Image Taker) to be deployed on a dedicated hardware edge. The API would be exposed as TCP exposing compressed images to its consumers. This will require to add a proper authentication on the current API. The rest of the tool chain, so the Orchestrator would have to add also this authentication to support this scenario.",

        "retrieved_context": "Using Git LFS and VFS for Git introduction\n\nGit LFS and VFS for Git are solutions for using Git with (large) binary files and large source trees. Git LFS\n\nGit is very good and keeping track of changes in text-based files like code, but it is not that good at tracking binary files. For instance, if you store a Photoshop image file (PSD) in a repository, with every change, the complete file is stored again in the history. This can make the history of the Git repo very large, which makes a clone of the repository more and more time-consuming. A solution to work with binary files is using Git LFS (or Git Large File System). This is an extension to Git and must be installed separately, and it can only be used with a repository platform that supports LFS. GitHub.com and Azure DevOps for instance are platforms that have support for LFS. The way it works in short, is that a placeholder file is stored in the repo with information for the LFS system. It looks something like this:\n\n{% raw %}\n\nshell\nversion https://git-lfs.github.com/spec/v1\noid a747cfbbef63fc0a3f5ffca332ae486ee7bf77c1d1b9b2de02e261ef97d085fe\nsize 4923023\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nThe actual file is stored in a separate storage. This way Git will track changes in this placeholder file, not the large file. The combination of using Git and Git LFS will hide this from the developer though. You will just work with the repository and files as before. When working with these large files yourself, you'll still see the Git history grown on your own machine, as Git will still start tracking these large files locally, but when you clone the repo, the history is actually pretty small. So it's beneficial for others not working directly on the large files. Pros of Git LFS\n\nUses the end to end Git workflow for all files\n\nGit LFS supports file locking to avoid conflicts for undiffable assets\n\nGit LFS is fully supported in Azure DevOps Services\n\nCons of Git LFS\n\nEveryone who contributes to the repository needs to install Git LFS\n\nIf not set up properly:\n\nBinary files committed through Git LFS are not visible as Git will only download the data describing the large file\n\nCommitting large binaries will push the full binary to the repository\n\nGit cannot merge the changes from two different versions of a binary file; file locking mitigates this\n\nAzure Repos do not support using SSH for repositories with Git LFS tracked files - for more information see the Git LFS authentication documentation\n\nInstallation and use of Git LFS\n\nGo to https://git-lfs.github.com and download and install the setup from there. For every repository you want to use LFS, you have to go through these steps:\n\nSetup LFS for the repo:\n\n{% raw %}\n\nshell\ngit lfs install\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nIndicate which files have to be considered as large files (or binary files). As an example, to consider all Photoshop files to be large:\n\n{% raw %}\n\nshell\ngit lfs track \"*.psd\"\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nThere are more fine-grained ways to indicate files in a folder and more. See the Git LFS Documentation. With these commands a .gitattribute file is created which contains these settings and must be part of the repository. From here on you just use the standard Git commands to work in the repository. The rest will be handled by Git and Git LFS. Common LFS commands\n\nInstall Git LFS\n\n{% raw %}\n\nbash\ngit lfs install       # windows\nsudo apt-get git-lfs  # linux\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nSee the Git LFS installation instructions for installation on other systems\n\nTrack .mp4 files with Git LFS\n\n{% raw %}\n\nbash\ngit lfs track '*.mp4'\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nUpdate the .gitattributes file listing the files and patterns to track\n\n{% raw %}\n\nbash\n*.mp4 filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text\ndocs/images/* filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nList all patterns tracked\n\n{% raw %}\n\nbash\ngit lfs track\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nList all files tracked\n\n{% raw %}\n\nbash\ngit lfs ls-files\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nDownload files to your working directory\n\n{% raw %}\n\nbash\ngit lfs pull\ngit lfs pull --include=\"path/to/file\"\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nVFS for Git\n\nImagine a large repository containing multiple projects, ex. one per feature.",

At least two of them should be available: the DevOps and Experimentation platform. The first component is the DevOps system, which is an obvious component. We assume that Git is one of the tools that should be used for prompt engineering. A prompt is not located in the vacuum, but it can be found in a code repository alongside experimentation scripts and notebooks. Therefore, if a software engineer or a data scientist is willing to create or tune prompts or related code, the first step there is to create a new branch. We would like to emphasize this obvious step here, because the branch name is an element that will allow us to build some rules around experiment naming. Any service that works on the top of Git including GitHub, Azure DevOps, Jenkins, GitLab, is good enough to host branches, invoke builds/flows and orchestrate the whole end-to-end process up to deployment into production. Another important tool is a service that allows us to log experiments alongside with their results.",

To do that, quantitative measurement (also known as evaluation metrics) with reference to ground truth output are needed. However, LLM applications are a recent and fast evolving AI field, where model evaluation is not straightforward and there is no unified approach to measure LLM performance. Several metrics have been proposed in the literature for evaluating the performance of LLMs. It is essential to use the right metrics suitable for the problem we are attempting to solve. This document covers several evaluation metrics and recent methods that are useful for evaluating these large models over various Natural Language Processing tasks. Traditional NLP and classification metrics\n\nTraditional metrics include:\n\nClassification metrics (for example, accuracy, F1-score) for scenarios where there is ground truth. Text similarity (for example, bleu, rouge, fuzzy) and semantic similarity (for example, cosine similarity) for scenarios where there is ground truth. Text similarity metrics\n\nText similarity metrics evaluators focus on computing similarity by comparing the overlap of word or word sequences between text elements. They\u2019re useful for producing a similarity score for predicted output from an LLM and reference ground truth text. These metrics also give an indication as to how well the model is performing for each respective task. Levenshtein Similarity Ratio\n\nThe Levenshtein Similarity Ratio is a string metric for measuring the similarity between two sequences. This measure is based on Levenshtein Distance. Informally, the Levenshtein Distance between two strings is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to change one string into the other. The Levenshtein Similarity Ratio can be calculated using Levenshtein Distance value and the total length of both sequences in the following definitions:\n\nLevenshtein Similarity Ratio (Simple Ratio):\n$$Lev.ratio(a, b) = {(|a|+|b|)-Lev.dist(a,b) \\over |a|+|b|}$$\nwhere |a| and |b| are the lengths of a and b. A few different methods are derived from Simple Levenshtein Similarity Ratio:\n\nPartial Ratio: Calculates the similarity by taking the shortest string, and compares it against the sub-strings of the same length in the longer string. Token-sort Ratio: Calculates the similarity by first splitting the strings into individual words or tokens, sorts the tokens alphabetically, and then recombines them into a new string. This new string is then compared using the simple ratio method. Token-set Ratio: Calculates the similarity by first splitting the strings into individual words or tokens, and then matches the intersection and union of the token sets between the two strings. {% if extra.ring == 'internal' %}\n\nffmodel Fuzzy Distance Evaluator: Fuzzy evaluator calculates the similarity between the prompt and the completions. {% endif %}\n\nBLEU Score\n\nThe BLEU (bilingual evaluation understudy) score evaluates the quality of machine-translated text from one natural language to another. Therefore, it\u2019s typically used for machine-translation tasks, however, it\u2019s also being used in other tasks such as text generation, paraphrase generation, and text summarization. The basic idea involves computing the precision, which is the fraction of candidate words in the reference translation. Scores are calculated for individual translated segments\u2014generally sentences\u2014by comparing them with a set of good quality reference translations. Those scores are then averaged over the whole corpus to reach an estimate of the translation's overall quality. Punctuation or grammatical correctness is not taken into account when scoring. Few human translations will attain a perfect BLEU score, since a perfect score would indicate that the candidate is identical to one of the reference translations. For this reason, it is not necessary to attain a perfect score. Given that there are more opportunities to match with the addition of multiple reference translations, we encourage having one or more reference translations that will be useful for maximizing the BLEU score. $$P = {m \\over w_t}$$\nm: Number of candidate words in reference. *wt: Total number of words in candidate.",

AKS Deploy\n\nTo deploy pods in a runtime Kubernetes C# Client allows using yaml templates, which will be\npopulated with container image URI and Environment Variables. ```csharp\nvar pod = await KubernetesYaml.LoadFromFileAsync(\"pod_template.yml\");\npod.Metadata.SetNamespace(namespace);\npod.Metadata.Name = podName;\npod.Metadata.Labels[\"app\"] = name;\nvar bundleContainer = pod.Spec.Containers.First(x => x.Name == \"bundle-container\");\nbundleContainer.Image = image;\nvar helperContainer = pod.Spec.Containers.First(x => x.Name == \"helper-container\");\nhelperContainer.Env.Add(new V1EnvVar(\"db_connection_string\", _dbConnectionString));\n\nawait _client.CoreV1.CreateNamespacedPodAsync(pod, _namespace);\n```\n\nIt takes several seconds to start a new pod in AKS. Simulated Bundle Application should have Managed Identity assigned to be able to connect to ServiceBus/Database/Simulator Orchestrator in a secure way to save results of testing. AKS Metrics\n\nSimulator Orchestrator can get CPU/Memory Metrics from Kubernetes Metrics Server. ```csharp\nvar metricsObject = (JsonElement)await _client.CustomObjects.GetNamespacedCustomObjectAsync(\"metrics.k8s.io\", \"v1beta1\", _namespace, \"pods\", podName);\nvar metrics = metricsObject.Deserialize();\nvar bundleContainerMetrics = metrics?.Containers.First(x => x.Name == \"bundle-container\");\n\nreturn new\n{\n  Cpu = bundleContainerMetrics.Usage[\"cpu\"].Value,\n  Memory = bundleContainerMetrics.Usage[\"memory\"].Value\n};\n```\n\nThe code above is the equivalent to the kubectl top pod --containers <podName> -n <_namespace> command. Metrics from the Kubernetes Metrics Server are available with a delay and show only average values within a specified time window. It means Simulator Orchestrator should be polling for metrics every N seconds from Kubernetes Metrics Server, store and find the highest number of CPU/Memory and potentially also store the averages. It's important that the simulation pod stays alive for a while to ensure all (delayed) metrics are obtained. Azure Container Instances approach\n\nSimulator Orchestrator is an application running on AKS cluster and this application is able to connect to Azure. Simulation Environment is Azure (Azure Resource Manager, Slot Resource Group, Azure Monitor). Simulated Bundle Application is a multi-container Azure Container Instance. ACI Security\n\nSimulator Orchestrator should have Service Principal / Managed Identity assigned with permissions to only create/delete Azure Container Instances in cloud platform Stamp/Slot resource group in Azure. This requires a Custom Azure AD Role with specific Microsoft.ContainerInstance/* permissions. Simulated Bundle Application should have Managed Identity assigned to be able to connect to ServiceBus/Database/Simulator Orchestrator in a secure way to save results of testing. Managed Identity for ACI is in Preview\n\nACI Deploy\n\nDeployment of Azure Container Instances at runtime from .NET application can be done in several ways:\n\nAzure.ResourceManager.ContainerInstance SDK - to create ACI via C# objects\n\nAzure.ResourceManager.Resources SDK + json ARM template\n\nAzure Resource Manager REST API\n\nThe recommended approach will be to use ContainerInstance SDK, at the time of writing just out of preview and a lot cleaner than using the raw API or the resources SDK with ARM templates. We need to assign a User Assigned Identity to these ACI resources that has the ability to ACRPull from the cloud platform and CVT Azure Container Registries. Deployment takes some time, about 1-2 minutes. This can be considered as a limited time, the test will anyway take from a few seconds to hour(s) for very heavy models. ACI Metrics\n\nSimulator Orchestrator can get CPU/Memory Metrics from Azure Monitor for ACI. ```csharp\nvar metricsClient = new MetricsQueryClient(new DefaultAzureCredential());\nstring resourceId = $\"/subscriptions/{configuration[\"subscriptionId\"]}/resourceGroups/{configuration[\"resourceGroup\"]}/providers/Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups/{name}\";\nvar metricsOptions = new MetricsQueryOptions()\n{\n    MetricNamespace = \"Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups\",\n    TimeRange = new QueryTimeRange(DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.AddMinutes(-30), DateTimeOffset.UtcNow),\n};\n\nmetricsOptions.Aggregations.Add(Azure.Monitor.Query.Models.MetricAggregationType.Maximum);\nmetricsOptions.Filter = \"containerName eq '*'\";\n\nvar results = await metricsClient.QueryResourceAsync(resourceId, new[] { \"MemoryUsage\", \"CpuUsage\" }, metricsOptions);\n// results variable contains timeseries values of MAX Memory and MAX CPU for each container in ACI for specified TimeRange. ```\n\nSimulator Orchestrator can get Metrics after testing is done, not needed to poll multiple times - Azure Monitor provides metrics for TimeRange.",

One of the challenges integrating Azure ML pipelines into AzDo CI/CD pipelines is that the Azure ML pipeline can take long time to execute and the Azure DevOps agent running CI/CD would timeout. The solution presented here uses agent-less Azure DevOps jobs and Azure ML ability to notify Azure DevOps upon the pipeline completion (aka Azure ML Job Wait). The Azure ML Wait Job is a special REST service the accepts a job id and Azure DevOps call back info. The callback will be invoked when a pipeline finishes either successfully or due to a failure. This callback can be used for CI/CD flows. There are two options of using the Azure ML Job Wait feature:\n\nUtilize Azure DevOps extension for Azure Machine Learning that is supporting by Azure ML team. Invoke the Azure ML Job Wait REST API directly using the InvokeRESTAPI task in Azure DevOps. Option 1. Using the extension\n\nWhile the feature is in preview, you need to fill this form to get access for yourself or for your customers. Once your request has been approved, you will be able to install the extension:\n\nThe following page contains very detailed information about how to use the extension. Additionally, we have added the extension into MLOps Template for Azure ML SDK v2 as well as MLOps Template for Azure CLI v2. Both templates demonstrate how to use the extension during the Continues Integration phase. This phase is a very common place to run a model long-running training on the full dataset. Option 2. Using the InvokeRESTAPI task\n\nAzure DevOps Builds have the Invoke Rest Api task which allows for the sending of an HTTP request and waiting for the response. To set it up the InvokeRESTAPI task a service connection is required. The connection doesn't contain any secure information, and it's just an object that contains an URI of a desired service. To setup it from Azure ML you can follow the steps below:\n\nSign in to your organization (https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization}}) and select your project. Select Project settings > Service connections. Select + New service connection, select Generic as the type of service connection that you need, and then select Next. Fill in the Server URL it should be in the following form: <https://{region}.experiments.azureml.net/webhook/v1.0/> where region is the region of your Azure ML workspace. The request to Azure ML will be authorized by providing the necessary information in the body so user name and password are not need to be filled in here. Specify the name of the service connection.

Branch policy enforcement\n\nProtected branch policies should be setup on the main branch to ensure that CI stage(s) have passed prior to starting a code review. Code review approvers will only start reviewing a pull request once the CI pipeline run passes for the latest pushed git commit. Broken builds should block pull request reviews. Prevent commits directly into main branch. Branch strategy\n\nRelease branches should auto trigger the deployment of a build artifact to its target cloud environment. You can find additional guidance on the Azure DevOps documentation site under the Manage deployments section\n\nDeliver Quickly and Daily\n\n\"By committing regularly, every committer can reduce the number of conflicting changes. Checking in a week's worth of work runs the risk of conflicting with other features and can be very difficult to resolve. Early, small conflicts in an area of the system cause team members to communicate about the change they are making.\"\n\nIn the spirit of transparency and embracing frequent communication across a dev crew, we encourage developers to commit code on a daily cadence. This approach provides visibility to feature progress and accelerates pair programming across the team. Here are some principles to consider:\n\nEveryone commits to the git repository each day\n\nEnd of day checked-in code should contain unit tests at the minimum. Run the build locally before checking in to avoid CI pipeline failure saturation. You should verify what caused the error, and try to solve it as soon as possible instead of committing your code.

Adatum Corporation has a large corpus of game plans that they have used to deliver solutions to their customers. These game plans have been exported as PDF documents, and contain a variety of information. The main focus of the gameplan documents are to outline a customer's problem statement, and the solution that Adatum will provide to solve that problem. The documents also contain information about the customer, the solution, and the impact of the problem. The format of the documents is not consistent, and there are many different templates that have been used over the years, and the documents may have mixes of images, text, tables and more. We need to extract the relevant information from these documents, and then use that information to build our solution. Why do we need to do data discovery? \"Garbage in, garbage out\" (GIGO): The performance of any Machine Learning model, custom or pre-trained (like an LLM), is only as good as the data.

        "retrieved_context": "Continuous Integration and Delivery\n\nContinuous Integration is the engineering practice of frequently committing code in a shared repository, ideally several times a day, and performing an automated build on it. These changes are built with other simultaneous changes to the system, which enables early detection of integration issues between multiple developers working on a project. Build breaks due to integration failures are treated as the highest priority issue for all the developers on a team and generally work stops until they are fixed. Paired with an automated testing approach, continuous integration also allows us to also test the integrated build such that we can verify that not only does the code base still build correctly, but also is still functionally correct. This is also a best practice for building robust and flexible software systems. Continuous Delivery takes the Continuous Integration concept further to also test deployments of the integrated code base on a replica of the environment it will be ultimately deployed on. This enables us to learn early about any unforeseen operational issues that arise from our changes as quickly as possible and also learn about gaps in our test coverage. The goal of all of this is to ensure that the main branch is always shippable, meaning that we could, if we needed to, take a build from the main branch of our code base and ship it on production. If these concepts are unfamiliar to you, take a few minutes and read through Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. Our expectation is that CI/CD should be used in all the engineering projects that we do with our customers and that we are building, testing, and deploying each change we make to any software system that we are building. For a much deeper understanding of all of these concepts, the books Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery provide a comprehensive background. Tools\n\nAzure Pipelines\n\nOur tooling at Microsoft has made setting up integration and delivery systems like this easy. If you are unfamiliar with it, take a few moments now to read through Azure Pipelines (Previously VSTS) and for a practical walkthrough of how this works in practice, one example you can read through is CI/CD on Kubernetes with VSTS.

Create and validate Pull Request for changes from a feature branch towards to the development branch. Publish and execute the pipeline in the development environment based on the full dataset. There are a few pieces of advice that we can provide:\n\nHost all different parameters that are required for pipeline publishing as environment variables. In this case, you will be able to initialize your local environment and publish the pipeline from a local computer. Or, you can use a variable group in your favorite DevOps system to publish the pipeline from there. Make sure the pipeline includes needed files only rather than everything from the repository. For example, Azure ML supports .amlignore file. Use branch names and build IDs to enable developers modifying the pipeline simultaneously (see below). Branch name utilization\n\nThe biggest challenge of the ML pipeline development process is how to modify and test the same pipeline from different branches. If we use fixed names for all experiments, models, and pipeline names, it will be hard to differentiate your own artifacts working in a large team. To make sure we can locate all feature branch-related experiments, we recommend using the feature branch name to mark all pipelines. Also, use the branch name in experiments and artifact names. This way, it will be possible to differentiate pipelines from different branches and help data scientists to log various feature-branch runs under the same name. The designed scripts can be utilized to publish pipelines and execute them from a local computer or from a DevOps system. Below is an example of how you can define Python variables based on initial environment variables and on a branch name:\n\n```py\npipeline_type = os.environ.get('PIPELINE_TYPE')\nsource_branch = os.environ.get('BUILD_SOURCEBRANCHNAME')\n\nmodel_name = f\"{pipeline_type}{os.environ.get('MODEL_BASE_NAME')}{source_branch}\"\npipeline_name = f\"{pipeline_type}{os.environ.get('PIPELINE_BASE_NAME')}{source_branch}\"\nexperiment_name = f\"{pipeline_type}{os.environ.get('EXPERIMENT_BASE_NAME')}{source_branch}\"\n```\n\nYou can see that in the code above we are using branch name and pipeline type. The second one is useful if you have several pipelines. To get a branch name from a local computer, you can use the following code:\n\npy\n    git_branch = subprocess.check_output(\"git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD\",\n                                         shell=True,\n                                         universal_newlines=True)\n\nPull request builds\n\nLet\u2019s start with introduction of two branch types that we are going to use in the process:\n\nFeature branch: any branch owned by a developer to develop a feature. Since we are not planning to preserve and manage this branch, the developer has to decide how to name the branch.",

One way to use environment variables is to leverage them by using the untracked .env file part of the solution, which is injected in the Dev Container. This file should contain environment variables such as tenant ID and subscription ID with no values. Each developer who clones the repository can create and fill in the file with the appropriate values; then, the file can be injected into the container by updating the devcontainer.json file with the following: `\"runArgs\": [\"--env-file\",\"config/.env\"]`. This way, the environment variables are sent to the container as soon as it starts. Nevertheless, in order to use Docker Compose, the developer needs to create a file called docker-compose.yml and add the following configuration, for instance, to inject environment variables: \n\n```\nversion: '3'\n\nservices:\n  my-workspace:\n    env_file: ../config/.env\n    build:\n      context: .\n      dockerfile: Dockerfile\n    command: sleep infinity\n```\n\nFinally, to use the docker-compose.yml file instead of Dockerfile, we need to adjust devcontainer.json with: `\"dockerComposeFile\": [\"docker-compose.yml\"]`.

Dev containers also allow us to:\n\nLeverage existing tools to enhance the Dev Containers with more features,\n\nProvide custom tools (such as scripts) for other developers. Existing tools\n\nIn the development phase, you will most probably need to use tools not installed by default in your Dev Container. For instance, if your project's target is to be deployed on Azure, you will need Azure-cli and maybe Terraform for resources and application deployment. You can find such Dev Containers in the VS Code dev container gallery repo. Some other tools may be:\n\nLinters for markdown files,\n\nLinters for bash scripts,\n\nEtc... Linting files that are not the source code can ensure a common format with common rules for each developer. These checks should be also run in a Continuous Integration Pipeline, but it is a good practice to run them prior opening a Pull Request. Limitation of custom tools\n\nIf you decide to include Azure-cli in your Dev Container, developers will be able to run commands against their tenant. However, to make the developers' lives easier, we could go further by letting them prefill their connection information, such as the tenant ID and the subscription ID in a secure and persistent way (do not forget that your Dev Container, being a Docker container, might get deleted, or the image could be rebuilt, hence, all customization inside will be lost). One way to achieve this is to leverage environment variables, with untracked .env file part of the solution being injected in the Dev Container.

In order now to inject the .env file into the container, you can update the file devcontainer.json with the following:\n\n{% raw %}\n\njson\n{\n    ... \"runArgs\": [\"--env-file\",\"config/.env\"],\n    ... }\n\n{% endraw %}\n\nAs soon as the Dev Container is started, these environment variables are sent to the container.

Discovery challenges for data consumers\n\nTraditionally, discovering enterprise data sources has been an organic process based on communal knowledge. For companies that want the most value from their information assets, this approach presents many challenges:\n\nBecause there's no central location to register data sources, users might be unaware of a data source unless they come into contact with it as part of another process. Unless users know the location of a data source, they can't connect to the data by using a client application. Data-consumption experiences require users to know the connection string or path. The intended use of the data is hidden to users unless they know the location of a data source's documentation. Data sources and documentation might live in several places and be consumed through different kinds of experiences. If users have questions about an information asset, they must locate the expert or team responsible for that data and engage them offline. There's no explicit connection between the data and the experts that understand the data's context. Unless users understand the process for requesting access to the data source, discovering the data source and its documentation won't help them access the data. Discovery challenges for data producers\n\nAlthough data consumers face the previously mentioned challenges, users who are responsible for producing and maintaining information assets face challenges of their own:\n\nAnnotating data sources with descriptive metadata is often a lost effort. Client applications typically ignore descriptions that are stored in the data source.",

The Retrieved Documents does not provide any information related to this specific question. However, if you need information about setting up a camera network, the Retrieved Documents contain relevant information that I can assist you with.",
        "retrieved_context": "More details in this document. Based on the fact that GigeVision and GenICam protocols used to stream pictures and control the camera are high speed UDP based protocols, it is important to avoid any element in the network that will slow down or analyzes this traffic. Also, the GenICam protocol forces to use the same port on all camera 3956 in UDP to control and pilot the camera settings. The mechanism used for the answer is to generate on the requester side a random port. This mechanism is important especially when accessing multiple cameras at the same time. This is illustrated in the network capture below:\n\nThe streaming mechanism with the GigeVision protocol is different as the requester can properly setup a streaming port. So a range of ports can be selected for this manner. Speed and large traffic is all what is important when GigeVision protocol has been designed. As an example, a Basler camera has a resolution of 2448x2440 and in 8 bits color, the raw image transferred will be: 2448 - 2440 - 8 - 3= 143 354 880 bytes (this is an example, size can vary). Count overhead of about 36 bytes per packet during transfer and to be able to read 1 image you'll stream about 3 of them, you'll quickly saturate a firewall or any element opening and interpreting the packets to route them. So it's *fundamental- to have the cameras in the same network as the VM or the machine running CVT. In the case of physical machine, it is even recommended to have a specific network dedicated to those cameras, see operationalization section below. Operationalization\n\nWhile installing the camera, the same network as the VM/Edge/Kubernetes or the machine has to be used. It is important that the VM will be granted access to the Azure cloud resources. The camera has no need to get any internet access. The key point is to have both VM and associated cameras on the same network without any filtering element between them. In the case of a VM, having all elements in the DMZ is one of the possible scenario\n\nIn the case of a physical machine running the same configuration as in a VM (not standalone but here, a connected scenario like in a VM but on a physical machine), the physical machine will have to have access as well to the Azure cloud resources. It can be in the DMZ or in another network but the could connectivity is a must as well. We expect those scenarios to be very consuming in terms of bandwidth as the main interest is to have a stronger machine being able to compute more elements on a dedicated use case. DMZ is a possible scenario as well for cameras and the physical machine but the network will most likely be used a lot by the cameras. Another possibility is to have the physical machine with 2 network card, one having access to the Azure cloud resources, DMZ network is a possibility. And as in the case of the physical machine, the camera may be close to the machine, it make sense to isolate them in a dedicated network connected to the second network card of the dedicated machine. In the case of CVT Standalone, any network, including fully isolated can be used. That say it may be handy to have the standalone version accessing the Azure cloud resources as well. In all cases during the installation of the camera, it is strongly recommended to use the tools provided by the different vendors. Each vendor has specific settings and will allow a proper configuration. For this, a direct connection between the camera and a laptop is largely enough. Once ready, all camera support a change of their IP address directly from those tools. The camera can then be unplugged from the laptop and plug into the proper destination network. Risks & Mitigation\n\nThe main risks with those GigeVision cameras is a network traffic saturation. They can output 30 raw images per seconds taking 1G of network bandwidth. This is mitigated by the fact we only take 1 image. Now to get 1 image, on some cameras, this requires to gather 2 to 3 images as they don't support single picture mode. So network separation needs to be done in a good way to allow a set of cameras and other equipments like a VM to properly operate together. There may be need of more network separation or having few dedicated hardware where camera do connect directly and acting like a gateway. This will technically look like the current Camera Interface (the Image Taker) to be deployed on a dedicated hardware edge. The API would be exposed as TCP exposing compressed images to its consumers. This will require to add a proper authentication on the current API. The rest of the tool chain, so the Orchestrator would have to add also this authentication to support this scenario.",

Each hypothesis statement should have a clearly defined success criteria, such as achieving an accuracy of over 60%. However, in some cases where no solution to the problem currently exists, the measure of success could be based on a subject-matter expert verifying that the results meet their expectations.

        "retrieved_context": "Make sure to consider the specific value added to the end user that the solution needs to address. This should include an understanding of the UX and the success criteria from a user perspective. Recommendations:\n\nExpect your first formulation of the problem to be overly ambitious. The hype around these models and the reality of their performance differs significantly in enterprise settings. Therefore, you should focus on the minimum functionality required to meet the business objective. There is another phase to refine the problem statement later. Think through the UX for the scenario that you are enabling, with a focus on the value that you are providing to the end users. No need to prototype or build anything at this stage. Use this to answer questions like:\n\nWhat information about the user\u2019s session is available at the time of inference? What is an acceptable user experience? What are you looking for in terms of \u201ccorrectness\u201d? Make sure to note these down as they will be key evaluation criteria later. How can you track the performance of your solution with end users? Some things to think about:\n\n\nExplicit signals like thumbs up/down or accept/reject feedback. Implicit signals like how many edits the end user makes to the response, if they bounce from the page, etc... Ask yourself \u201cWhat task-specific information or data would an expert need to be successful in solving the use case, and how do I retrieve that information or data? \u201d This will help you refine what sources of information must be included in the solution to get the right answer. Remember that the outputs from a LLM are non-deterministic and will occasionally be wrong. Make sure to think through any potential risks of showing the end user the results directly. Mitigation plans will be different depending on the scenario and the customer\u2019s risk tolerance. Start thinking about failure cases now. Solutions around non-deterministic models require special attention to unhappy path handling. Are there any ways that you can minimize the impact of an incorrect generation? If possible, consult with the end users of the solution to understand their specific pain points. Also, the problem statement should come from the business objectives of the customer. Resist the urge to propose scope and scenarios based on the LLM hype. Everything must tie back to the customer\u2019s needs. Deliverables:\n\nAgreement on what success looks like for the end users. In addition, make sure you have answers to the following questions:\n\nCan the user validate the accuracy? How is success measured? What is success when the model is inevitably wrong? Clear enumeration of the targeted scenarios. Be as specific as possible. A set of example user inputs and expected outputs to cover each scenario. Ideally these examples come from an end user or a project owner. Enumeration of responsible AI concerns. You should start formulating your mitigation plan at this point, even if the details need to be experimented with. Data:\n\nExample user input, output pairs for each scenario that you are targeting. It is important to capture variability in the data and have representation of all use cases. We recommend having multiple variations of prompt language, e.g. 10, for these points. These pairs should be sourced from multiple individuals to get a diversity of phrasings\n\nIn addition, if your scenario requires additional data/context to be included in the prompt submitted to the LLM, make sure to have representative samples. For instance, in a Q&A, or a summarization case, it is useful to have samples of their documents. Tools:\n\nConsider how you are going to capture and manage your data at this phase. The gold standard is a mechanism to capture data in-situ. This allows people in the same context as your end users to formulate their requests and give examples of what they expect back. Preliminary Exploration\n\nIn this stage, the goal is to explore different prompt ideas and qualitatively assess the output of the LLM. More specifically, a small dataset can be used to test different prompts and observe the output diversity, coherence, and relevance. This can help in understanding the power and limits of the LLM, defining data requirements, and planning for experimentation. Simple Jupyter notebooks or the Azure OpenAI playground can be used to interact with the LLM. Recommendations:\n\nAs you use the playground to explore the model\u2019s performance, make sure that you add any new data points you create to your dataset. When in the playground, it is often tempting to tweak the input string (that you\u2019d normally get from an end-user) to get the correct output. These should be thought of as different data points, as we have no control over what the user inputs. The goal of the exploration should be to get an idea of the model\u2019s performance and limitations. Also, take note of what types of additional information you need to pass in the prompt to get the correct answer. This will inform your solution. The less that the model knows about your subject, the more information you will need to pass through prompt engineering (or fine tuning). Also, the chance of hallucinations is higher in this scenario. Look for key words or phrases to ground the model into your specific task at this point. A great example is specifying import statements for code generation scenarios. Look for different ways you can encode this information when passing it to the LLM. A good example of this is providing table schema information as comments vs. as a CREATE TABLE statement in a SQL code generation scenario. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis on your data set to understand the distributions. Note down how you determine if the generation is correct. These will help dictate what post-processing and automated evaluation you should create for running experiments. A few guiding questions:\n\nWhat pieces of the completion are you looking for? Are there any red flags that tell you the result will be wrong? For example, invalid format or syntax, or an empty output? How do you think about correctness? Is it binary? Relative? Is close good enough? Are there available metrics that can measure the above? or is there a need to implement custom metrics?",

The focus of these tests, which are sometimes named \"watchdog\", \"active monitoring\" or \"synthetic transactions\", is to verify the product's health and resilience continuously. Why Synthetic Monitoring tests\n\nTraditionally, software providers rely on testing through CI/CD stages in the well known testing pyramid (unit, integration, e2e) to validate that the product is healthy and without regressions. Such tests will run on the build agent or in the test/stage environment before being deployed to production and released to live user traffic. During the services' lifetime in the production environment, they are safeguarded by monitoring and alerting tools that rely on Real User Metrics/Monitoring (RUM). However, as more organizations today provide highly-available (99.9+ SLA) products, they find that the nature of long-lived distributed applications, which typically rely on several hardware and software components, is to fail. Frequent releases (sometimes multiple times per day) of various components of the system can create further instability. This rapid rate of change to the production environment tends to make testing during CI/CD stages not hermetic and actually not representative of the end user experience and how the production system actually behaves. For such systems, the ambition of service engineering teams is to reduce to a minimum the time it takes to fix errors, or the MTTR - Mean Time To Repair. It is a continuous effort, performed on the live/production system. Synthetic Monitors can be used to detect the following issues:\n\nAvailability - Is the system or specific region available. Transactions and customer journeys - Known good requests should work, while known bad requests should error.",

When the pipeline is triggered, all nested YAML files are expanded to run in Azure Pipelines. This checklist contains some tips and tricks for reviewing all nested YAML files. These documents may be useful when reviewing YAML files:\n\nAzure Pipelines YAML documentation. Pipeline run sequence\n\nKey concepts for new Azure Pipelines\n\nKey concepts overview\n\nA trigger tells a Pipeline to run. A pipeline is made up of one or more stages. A pipeline can deploy to one or more environments. A stage is a way of organizing jobs in a pipeline and each stage can have one or more jobs. Each job runs on one agent. A job can also be agentless. Each agent runs a job that contains one or more steps. A step can be a task or script and is the smallest building block of a pipeline. A task is a pre-packaged script that performs an action, such as invoking a REST API or publishing a build artifact. An artifact is a collection of files or packages published by a run.

Assuming that prompts of higher sizes are similar in complexity and the size of the response generated is fixed, increasing the prompt size will increase the overall latency, but not at a significant rate.

Let\u2019s show how our generalized pipeline will look from a technologies perspective:\n\nWhen to implement an ML pipeline\n\nData scientists generally prefer using Jupyter Notebooks for Exploratory Data Analysis and initial experiments. Requiring the use of pipelines at this stage may be premature, as it could limit the data scientists technology choices and overall creativity. Not every Jupyter notebook is going to create a need for a production pipeline, as the data scientists need to test many different approaches and ideas before converging on an approach. Until that work is done, it is hard to design a pipeline. While the initial experimentation can be done in a notebook, there are some good signals that tell when it is time to start moving experiments from a notebook to an ML pipeline:\n\nThe approach and code are stabilizing, meaning it's reasonable to begin transitioning from research to development. Data scientists are ready to share the same code and experiment with different parameters. Data scientists need more compute resources since a single VM or a local computer is no longer sufficient. When these things begin happening, it\u2019s time to wrap up experimentation and implement a pipeline with technology such as the Azure ML Pipeline SDK. We recommend following a three-step approach:\n\nStep 1. Refactor the notebook into clean Python code. The primary goal being to move all methods/classes to separate Python files to make them independent from the execution environment. Step 2. Convert the existing notebook to a single step pipeline. You can use the following guideline to create a single-step pipeline to execute on a single instance only. The only difference is it is your own code in train.py.

Here is an example of an Azure ML pipeline definition: https://github.com/microsoft/mlops-basic-template-for-azureml-cli-v2/blob/main/mlops/nyc-taxi/pipeline.yml. This YAML file defines a series of steps (called \"jobs\" in the YAML) consisting of the Python scripts which execute a training pipeline. The examples follow this sequence of steps:\n\nprep_job, which processes and cleans the raw data\n\ntransform_job, which shapes the cleansed data to match the training job's expected inputs\n\ntrain_job, which trains the model\n\npredict_job, which uses a test set of data to run a set of predictions through the trained model\n\nscore_job, which takes the predictions, and scores them against the ground truth labels. Each of these steps references a Python script, which was likely once a set of cells in a notebook.",

Function calling worked in both GPT3.5 and GPT4, but could sometimes fail in GPT3.5 with hallucination or empty values, even when the arguments were sent as \u201crequired\u201d. The team had to implement workarounds to address this problem. A thorough evaluation of the model, more prompt engineering, and extra coding were necessary to ensure the solution worked well with GPT3.5. However, the better response time compared to GPT4 made this effort a good investment.",

Overview\n\nAI-enabled object detection and tracking is a powerful solution that utilizes object detection models such as YOLO, RCNN, FastRCNN or FasterRCNN, combined with OpenCV-based object tracking algorithms. This approach enables real-time detection and tracking of objects of interest in a video feed, making it an ideal solution for a variety of applications. While traditional machine learning models require significant amounts of expertise to build, there are several platforms available that can simplify the process. These include Azure AutoML for images, Custom Vision, or Custom Object Detection Models. One of the most common scenarios for AI-enabled object detection and tracking is people counting in real-time. This application is useful in a variety of settings, including retail stores, airports, and public spaces. By detecting and tracking individuals as they move through a space, businesses and organizations can gain valuable insights into foot traffic patterns and make informed decisions about staffing, product placement, and more. In addition to people counting, object detection and tracking can also be used to track vehicles, machinery, materials, and other objects on a shop floor or in a production environment. Another key application of AI-enabled object detection and tracking is safety and security monitoring. By detecting and tracking objects in real-time, businesses can quickly identify potential safety or security breaches and take immediate action to prevent accidents, theft, or other incidents. This technology can also be used to detect defects in a production line, which can help companies identify quality control issues and improve product consistency. Finally, AI-enabled object detection and tracking can be used to manage traffic, such as in smart city applications, by detecting and tracking vehicles in real-time and optimizing traffic flow to reduce congestion and improve safety. This solution supports some common scenarios:\n\nCounting people in real-time\n\nTracking objects, such as cars, machinery, materials on the shop-floor\n\nDetecting safety or security breaches\n\nDetecting defects in a production line\n\nManaging traffic. The Technical Solution in a Nutshell\n\nIn its simplest form, the solution involves the artifacts depicted below:\n\nIts components are:\n\nA camera, running on the user's premises, produces a video stream, usually using rtsp or rtmp protocol\n\nThat video stream is sent through to an AI model to detect a specific object (for instance, persons, or some other moving objects)\n\nFurther processing is performed on the detected objects (for instance: counting the number of people, or obfuscating the detected image for privacy, or detecting an unsafe situation)\n\nThe original video plus the result of AI and further processing are merged and sent to another video stream. Both the original and the processed video-streams are then available for viewing in real-time. Challenges\n\nOne challenge that the Real Time Object Detection and Tracking on the Edge solution helps address is the need for real-time detection and tracking of objects in a video feed. Traditional machine learning models can be time-consuming to develop, making it difficult to achieve real-time results. However, this solution utilizes object detection models like YOLO, RCNN, FastRCNN, or FasterRCNN, combined with OpenCV-based object tracking algorithms, to enable real-time object detection and tracking on the edge. By detecting and tracking objects in real-time, businesses can gain valuable insights and take immediate action to prevent accidents, theft, or other incidents. Another challenge that this solution helps address is the need for automated people counting in real-time. By detecting and tracking individuals as they move through a space, businesses and organizations can gain valuable insights into foot traffic patterns and make informed decisions about staffing, product placement, and more. The Real Time Object Detection and Tracking on the Edge solution supports counting people in real-time and can provide businesses with valuable data to optimize their operations. Furthermore, the Real Time Object Detection and Tracking on the Edge solution helps address the need for privacy in video feeds. The solution offers the ability to obfuscate the detected image for privacy while still providing real-time object detection and tracking. This ensures that the privacy of individuals captured on the video feed is protected while still providing businesses with valuable data to optimize their operations. Deployment on the Edge\n\nMost of the time, processing needs to be done on a compute closer to action. The AI model needs to run as often as every 300~400ms - and it is impractical to serve the model in the cloud. The video stream needs to be available on-premise, closer to action. For those reasons, this solution is ofter deployed \"on the edge\", i.e. on a compute that lives outside the cloud. Edge MLOps\n\nA series of containers must be deployed to the edge to make up this solution:\n\nA video streaming solution - that relays the original video stream to one or more formats\n\nOne or more AI \"enrichers\" - that collects the original stream, pipes it through the model, processes it further and relays it to the streaming solution\n\nOne or more AI models - these can be open source models, or custom models produced with Azure ML, or other solutions such as Azure Custom Vision\n\nA Video Player - a front-end solution that can be used to visualize the produced streams. We follow similar pattern defined for MLOps for Edge to generate, package, and deploying those containers to the one or more edge devices.

Specifically, the test checks that the value of the first pixel in the padded area is 0 and the value of the last pixel in the padded region is 1. This test ensures that the function is working as expected and properly pads the image to maintain its aspect ratio.
