    "\n",
    "According to [multiple estimates](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/tapping-power-unstructured-data), 80% of data generated by businesses today is unstructured data such as text, images, or audio. This data has enormous potential for machine learning applications, but there is _some_ work to be done before it can be used directly. [Embeddings](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/introduction-to-word-embeddings-c2ba135dce2f) are the backbone of our system. Our goal is to understand how different embeddings have an impact on the returned results for a given query.\n",
