    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, we will build the building blocks of a RAG solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Creation of a Search Index\n",
    "2. Upload of data\n",
    "3. Perform search\n",
    "4. Creation of a prompt\n",
    "5. Wire everything together\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- To create the index we need the following objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Source - a `link` to some data storage\n",
    "- Azure Index - defines the data structure over which to search\n",
    "  - Create an empty index based on an index schema\n",
    "  - Fill in the data using the Search Indexer (below\\_)\n",
    "- Azure Search Indexer - which acts as a crawler that retrieves data from external sources, can also trigger skillsets (Optical Character Recognition) -->\n",

    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this section is to familiarize yourself with RAG in a hands-on way, so that later on we can experiment with different aspects.\n",

In Red Team Testing, two developers jointly decide on the interface, architecture, and design of the program, and then separate for the implementation phase. One developer writes tests using the public interface, attempting to perform edge case testing, input validation, and otherwise stress testing the interface. The second developer is simultaneously writing the implementation which will eventually be tested.\\n\\nRed Team Testing has the same philosophy as any other Test-Driven Development lifecycle: All implementation is separated from the interface, and the interface can be tested with no knowledge of the implementation.\\n\\nSteps\\n\\nDesign Phase: Both developers design the interface together.

The pairing assignee may be in the process of upskilling, nevertheless, they are equal partners in the development effort.\\nBelow are some general guidelines for pairing:\\n\\nUpon assignment of the story/product backlog item (PBI), the pair needs to be deliberate about defining how to work together and have a firm definition of the work to be completed.

This will allow you to easily change the behavior of your application during testing.

If a range of defaults need to change together, consider one or more parameters which set \"modes\", changing the defaults of a group of parameters together.\\n\\nDocument at startup.

A reason for this is that E2E tests give developers the highest confidence to release as they are testing the \"real\" system.\\n\\nCDC addresses these issues by testing interactions between components in isolation using mocks that conform to a shared understanding documented in a \"contract\". Contracts are agreed between consumer and provider, and are regularly verified against a real instance of the provider component. This effectively partitions a larger system into smaller pieces that can be tested individually in isolation of each other, leading to simpler, fast and stable tests that also give confidence to release.',\n",

This may sound counterintuitive, but it helps providers create APIs that fit the real requirements of the consumers rather than trying to guess these in advance. Next we describe the CDC building blocks ordered by their occurrence in the development cycle.\\n\\nConsumer Tests with Provider Mock\\n\\nThe consumers start by creating integration tests against a provider mock and running them as part of their CI pipeline. Expected responses are defined in the provider mock for requests fired from the tests. Through this, the consumer essentially defines the contract they expect the provider to fulfill.\\n\\nContract\\n\\nContracts are generated from the expectations defined in the provider mock as a result of a successful test run.

Lastly the finalized contract is versioned and stored in a central place accessible by both consumer and provider.\\n\\nContracts are complementary to API specification documents like OpenAPI. API specifications describe the structure and the format of the API. A contract instead specifies that for a given request, a given response is expected. An API specifications document is helpful in writing an API contract and can be used to validate that the contract conforms to the API specification.\\n\\nProvider Contract Verification\\n\\nOn the provider side tests are also executed as part of a separate pipeline which verifies contracts against real responses of the provider. Contract verification fails if real responses differ from the expected responses as specified in the contract. The cause of this can be:\\n\\nInvalid expectations on the consumer side leading to incompatibility with the current provider implementation\\n\\nBroken provider implementation due to some missing functionality or a regression\\n\\nEither way, thanks to CDC it is easy to pinpoint integration issues down to the consumer/provider of the affected interaction.

Contracts offer a formal way to document the shared understanding how components interact with each other, and serve as a base for the communication between teams. In a way, the contract repository serves as a live documentation of all consumer-provider interactions of a system.\\n\\nCDC has some drawbacks as well.

Modern applications are built with an increasing number of dependencies; on infrastructure, platform, network, 3rd party software or APIs, etc. Such systems increase the risk of impact from dependency disruptions. Each dependent component may fail. Furthermore, its interactions with other components may propagate the failure.\\n\\nFault injection methods are a way to increase coverage and validate software robustness and error handling, either at build-time or at run-time, with the intention of \"embracing failure\" as part of the development lifecycle. These methods assist engineering teams in designing and continuously validating for failure, accounting for known and unknown failure conditions, architect for redundancy, employ retry and back-off mechanisms, etc.\\n\\nApplicable to\\n\\nSoftware - Error handling code paths, in-process memory management.\\n\\nExample tests: Edge-case unit/integration tests and/or load tests (i.e. stress and soak).\\n\\nProtocol - Vulnerabilities in communication interfaces such as command line parameters or APIs.',\n",

This method of testing confirms that an aggregate of a system, or sub-system, works together correctly or otherwise exposes erroneous behavior between two or more units of code.\\n\\nWhy Integration Testing\\n\\nBecause one component of a system may be developed independently or in isolation of another it is important to verify the interaction of some or all components. A complex system may be composed of databases, APIs, interfaces, and more, that all interact with each other or additional external systems. Integration tests expose system-level issues such as broken database schemas or faulty third-party API integration. It ensures higher test coverage and serves as an important feedback loop throughout development.\\n\\nIntegration Testing Design Blocks\\n\\nConsider a banking application with three modules: login, transfers, and current balance, all developed independently. An integration test may verify when a user logs in they are re-directed to their current balance with the correct amount for the specific mock user. Another integration test may perform a transfer of a specified amount of money. The test may confirm there are sufficient funds in the account to perform the transfer, and after the transfer the current balance is updated appropriately for the mock user. The login page may be mocked with a test user and mock credentials if this module is not completed when testing the transfers module.',\n",

Additionally, integration tests can utilize mock data in order to simulate a complete system.

A low number here is a positive sign that disk has excess capacity to service or write requests from the operating system. Avg. Disk sec/Read and Avg. Disk sec/Write These both measure the latency of your disks. Latency is defined as the average time it takes for a disk transfer to complete. You obviously want is low numbers as possible but need to be careful to account for inherent speed differences between SSD and traditional spinning disks. For this counter is important to define a baseline after the hardware is installed. Then use this value going forward to determine if you are experiencing any latency issues related to the hardware. Disk Reads/sec and Disk Writes/sec These counters each measure the total number of IO requests completed per second. Similar to the latency counters, good and bad values for these counters depend on your disk hardware but values higher than your initial baseline don't normally point to a hardware issue in this case. This counter can be useful to\",\n",

This approach is monitoring and capturing differences between two environments then compare and reduces all risks before you introduce a new feature/release.\\n\\nIn our test cases, code coverage is very important however sometimes providing code coverage can be tricky to replicate real-life combinations and possibilities. In this approach, to test V-Next environment we have side by side deployment, we\\'re replicating the same traffic with V-Current environment and directing same traffic to V-Next environment, the only difference is we don\\'t return any response from V-Next environment to users, but we collect those responses to compare with V-Current responses.\\n\\nReferencing back to one of the Principles of Chaos Engineering, mentions importance of sampling real traffic like below:\\n\\nSystems behave differently depending on environment and traffic patterns. Since the behavior of utilization can change at any time, sampling real traffic is the only way to reliably capture the request path. To guarantee both authenticity of the way in which the system is exercised and relevance to the current deployed system, Chaos strongly prefers to experiment directly on production traffic.',\n",

In those cases unit, functional and integration/e2e testing would be the primary means.  UI Testing is going to be mainly applicable when dealing with a public facing UI that is used in a diverse environment or in a mission critical UI that requires higher fidelity.

UI tests can take a significant amount of time to both implement and run, and it's challenging to test every type of user interaction in a production application due to the large number of possible interactions.\\n\\nDesigning the UI tests around the functional tests makes sense.

Depending on the UI testing framework you choose will result in either a smoother test creation experience, or a very frustrating and time-consuming one.

A strong unit\\ntest suite helps increase the confidence of the developer that their change is not going to cause any downstream bugs.\\nHaving unit tests also helps with making safe, mechanical refactors that are provably safe; using things like\\nrefactoring tools to do mechanical refactoring and running unit tests that cover the refactored code should be enough to\\nincrease confidence in the commit.\\n\\nSpeed up development\\n\\nUnit tests take time to write, but they also speed up development? While this may seem like an oxymoron, it is one of\\nthe strengths of a unit testing suite - over time it continues to grow and evolve until the tests become an essential\\npart of the developer workflow.',\n",

A code review is having someone go over the code in a PR and validate it before it is merged, but, in general, code reviews can take place outside PRs too.\\n\\nCode Review Pull Request Source code focused Intended to enhance and enable code reviews. Includes both source code but can have a broader scope (e.g., docs, integration tests, compiles) Intended for early feedback before submitting a PR Not intended for early feedback . Created when author is ready to merge Usually a synchronous review with faster feedback cycles (draft PRs as an exception). Examples: scheduled meetings, over-the-shoulder review, pair programming Usually a tool assisted asynchronous review but can be elevated to a synchronous meeting when needed\\n\\nWhy do we need code reviews?\\n\\nOur peer code reviews are structured around best practices, to find specific kinds of errors. Much like you would still run a linter over mobbed code, you would still ask someone to make the last pass to make sure the code conforms to expected standards and avoids common pitfalls.\\n\\nPRs are too large, how can we fix this?',\n",

As an example, Azure managed app services allows developers to validate app changes in a staging deployment slot before swapping it with the production slot.

Slot swapping also simplifies release rollbacks once a technical operator restores the slots to their pre-swap states.\\n\\nKubernetes natively supports rolling updates.\\n\\nBlue-Green Deployments\\n\\nBlue / Green is a deployment technique which reduces downtime by running two identical instances of a production environment called Blue and Green.\\n\\nOnly one of these environments accepts live production traffic at a given time.\\n\\nIn the above example, live production traffic is routed to the Green environment. During application releases, the new version is deployed to the blue environment which occurs independently from the Green environment. Live traffic is unaffected from Blue environment releases.

One key feature that GitHub Actions has not yet implemented is the ability to mock and inject runtime variables into a workflow, in order to test the pipeline itself.\\n\\nThis provides a bridge between a pre-existing feature in Azure DevOps, and one that has not yet released inside GitHub Actions.\\n\\nTarget Audience\\n\\nThis guide assumes that you are familiar with CI/CD, and understand the security implications of CI/CD pipelines. We also assume basic knowledge with GitHub Actions, including how to write and run a basic CI/CD pipeline, checkout repositories inside the action, use Marketplace Actions with version control, etc.\\n\\nWe assume that you, as a CI/CD engineer, want to inject environment variables or environment flags into your pipelines and workflows in order to test them, and are using GitHub Actions to accomplish this.\\n\\nUsage Scenario\\n\\nMany integration or end-to-end workflows require specific environment variables that are only available at runtime.

Multiple workflows also helps to keep the deployments to the environments independent thus reducing the time to deploy and find issues earlier than later in the process. Also, since the environments are independent of each other, any failures in deploying to one environment does not block deployments to other environments.

To do that, it must reference the name of the virtual network, as well as the resource group it is deployed in.

Analyze your infrastructure code and identify the logical components that can be separated into reusable modules. This will give you a clear separation of concerns and will make it straight forward to include new resources, update existing ones or reuse them in the future. For more details on modules and when to use them, see the Terraform guidance.\\n\\nPlace the .tf module files at the root of each folder and make sure to include a README file in a markdown format which can be automatically generated based on the module code. It's recommended to follow this approach as this file structure will be automatically picked up by the Terraform Registry.\\n\\nUse a consistent set of files to structure your modules.

Even with a database that offers serializability, it is possible that within a transaction or connection you are leveraging a lower isolation level than the database offers. In particular, read uncommitted (or eventual consistency), can have a lot of unpredictable side effects and introduce bugs that are difficult to reason about. Eventually consistent systems should be treated as a last resort for achieving your scalability requirements; batching, sharding, and caching are all recommended solutions to increase your scalability. If none of these options are tenable, consider evaluating the \"New SQL\" databases like CockroachDB or TiDB, before leveraging an option that relies on eventual consistency.',\n",

Snapshot Isolation, strict serializability, \"read your own writes\", monotonic reads, bounded staleness, causal consistency, and linearizability are all other terms you can look into to learn more on the subject.\\n\\nConcurrency Control\\n\\nYour systems should (almost) always leverage some form of concurrency control, to ensure correctness amongst competing requests and to prevent data races. The 2 forms of concurrency control are pessimistic and optimistic.\\n\\nA pessimistic transaction involves a first request to \"lock the data\", and a second request to write the data. In between these requests, no other requests touching that data will succeed. See 2 Phase Locking (also often known as 2 Phase Commit) for more info.\\n\\nThe (more) recommended approach is optimistic concurrency, where a user can read the object at a specific version, and update the object if and only if it hasn\\'t changed. This is typically done via the Etag Header.\\n\\nA simple way to accomplish this on the database side is to increment a version number on each update.

This readme is intended to assist developers in the decision-making process needed to build dev containers. The guidance provided should be especially helpful if you are experiencing VS Code dev containers for the first time.\\n\\nNote: This guide is not about setting up a Docker file for deploying a running Python program for CI/CD.\\n\\nPrerequisites\\n\\nExperience with VS Code\\n\\nExperience with Docker\\n\\nWhat are dev containers?\\n\\nDevelopment containers are a VS Code feature that allows developers to package a local development tool stack into the internals of a Docker container while also bringing the VS Code UI experience with them. Have you ever set a breakpoint inside a Docker container? Maybe not. Dev containers make that possible. This is all made possible through a VS Code extension called the Remote Development Extension Pack that works together with Docker to spin-up a VS Code Server within a Docker container. The VS Code UI component remains local, but your working files are volume mounted into the container. The diagram below, taken directly from the official VS Code docs, illustrates this:\",\n",

Dev containers are defined by their base image, and the artifacts that support that base image. The base image and the artifacts that come with it live in the .devcontainer directory. This directory is where configuration begins. A central artifact to the dev container definition is a configuration file called devcontainer.json. This file orchestrates the artifacts needed to support the base image and the dev container lifecycle.

This is especially helpful when a change requires changes to a shared contract between multiple components. For example, a story requires that an api endpoint is changed. With this strategy the api and web client could be updated with the same pull request. This avoids the main branch being broken temporarily while waiting on dependent pull requests to merge.\\n\\nMinimize Remote Dependencies for Local Development\\n\\nThe fewer dependencies on components that cannot run a developer's machine translate to fewer steps required to get started. Therefore, fewer dependencies will positively impact the measures above.\\n\\nThe following strategies can be used to reduce these dependencies\\n\\nUse an Emulator\\n\\nIf available, emulators are implementations of technologies that are typically only available in cloud environments.

This is the recommended approach for pre-production or production environments.\\n\\nAccessing protected resources from a local machine implies one of the following options:\\n\\nUse a VPN\\n\\nUse a jump box\\n\\nWith SSH activated (less secure)\\n\\nWith Bastion (recommended approach)\\n\\nHowever, a developer may want to deploy a test environment (in a non-production subscription) for their tests during development phase, without the complexity of networking.\\n\\nIn addition, infrastructure code should not be duplicated: it has to be the same whether resources are deployed in a production like environment or in development environment.\\n\\nOption\\n\\nThe idea is to offer, via a single boolean variable, the option to deploy resources behind a VNet or not using one infrastructure code base. Securing resources behind a VNet usually implies that public accesses are disabled and private endpoints are created. This is something to have in mind because, as a developer, public access must be activated in order to connect to this environment.',\n",

When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic.\\n\\nUse cases for machine-readable API definition documents include, but are not limited to: interactive documentation; code generation for documentation, clients, and servers; and automation of test cases. OpenAPI documents describe an APIs services and are represented in either YAML or JSON formats. These documents may either be produced and served statically or be generated dynamically from an application.\\n\\nThere are implementations available for many languages like C#, including low-level tooling, editors, user interfaces, code generators, etc. Here you can find a list of known tooling for the different languages: OpenAPI-Specification/IMPLEMENTATIONS.md.\\n\\nUsing Microsoft TypeSpec',\n",

This makes it a versatile option for developers who need to work with a range of different API styles and technologies.\\n\\nMicrosoft TypeSpec is a widely adopted tool within Azure teams, particularly for generating OpenAPI Specifications in complex and interconnected APIs that span multiple teams. To ensure consistency across different parts of the API, teams commonly leverage shared libraries which contain reusable patterns.

For DocFx to generate quality reference documentation, quality triple slash-comments are required. See Triple-slash (///) Code Comments Support. To enforce this, it's a good idea to enforce the use of StyleCop. There are a few steps that will give you an easy start with this.\\n\\nFirst, you can use the Directory.Build.props file in the /src folder in combination with the files in the build/dotnet folder. By having this, you enforce StyleCop in all Visual Studio project files in it's sub folders with a configuration of which rules should be used or ignored. You can tailor this to your needs of course. For more information, see Customize your build and Use rule sets to group code analysis rules.\\n\\nTo make sure developers are forced to add the triple-slash comments by throwing compiler errors and to have the proper settings for the generation of documentation XML-files, add the TreatWarningsAsErrors and GenerateDocumentationFile settings to every .csproj file.

Is the model performing better than the baseline?\\n\\nA good way to think of a model baseline is the simplest model one can come up with: either a simple threshold, a random guess or a very basic linear model. This baseline is the reference point your model needs to outperform. A well-defined baseline is different for each problem type and there is no one size fits all approach.\\n\\nAs an example, let's consider some common types of machine learning problems:\\n\\nClassification: Predicting between a positive and a negative class.

Additionally, human accuracy at labelling can also be the baseline in an image classification scenario.\\n\\nSome questions to ask when comparing to a baseline:\\n\\nHow does your model compare to a random guess?\\n\\nHow does your model performance compare to applying a simple threshold?\\n\\nHow does your model compare with always predicting the most common value?\\n\\nNote: In some cases, human parity might be too ambitious as a baseline, but this should be decided on a case by case basis.

Depending on the data type and model, the model metrics calculation might differ in production and in training. For example, the training procedure calculated metrics for a long period of time (a year, a decade) with different seasonal characteristics while the scoring procedure will calculate the metrics per a restricted time interval (for example a week, a month, a quarter). Well-defined ML performance metrics are essential in production so that a decrease or increase in model performance can be accurately detected.\\n\\nThings to consider:\\n\\nIn forecasting, if you change the period of assessing the performance, from one month to a year for example, then you might get a different result. For example, if your model is predicting sales of a product per day and the RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) is very low for the first month the model is in production. As the model is live for longer, the RMSE is increasing, becoming 10x the RMSE for the first year compared to the first month.',\n",

For example, a classifier has an accuracy of 80% overall, but only 55% for the 20-30 age group. If this is a significant age group for the production data, then your accuracy might suffer greatly when in production.\\n\\nIn scene classification scenario, the model is trying to identify a specific scene in a video, and the model has been trained and tested (80-20 split) on 50000 segments where half are segments containing the scene and half of the segments do not contain the scene. The accuracy on the training set is 85% and 84% on the test set. However, when an entire video is scored, scores are obtained on all segments, and we expect few segments to contain the scene. The accuracy for an entire video is not comparable with the training/test set procedure in this case, hence different metrics should be considered.\\n\\nIf sampling techniques (over-sampling, under-sampling) are used to train model when classes are imbalanced, ensure the metrics used during training are comparable with the ones used in scoring.\\n\\nIf the number of samples used for training and testing is small, the performance metrics might change significantly as new data is scored.\\n\\nIs the model benchmarked?',\n",

It is important to identify if the ground truth can be obtained as the model is scoring new data by either manual or automatic means. If the ground truth cannot be obtained systematically, other proxies and methodology should be investigated in order to obtain some measure of model performance.\\n\\nOne option is to use humans to manually label samples. One important aspect of human labelling is to take into account the human accuracy. If there are two different individuals labelling an image, the labels will likely be different for some samples.

For a retail website for example, click/not click, buy/not buy or other user interaction with recommendation can be used as ground truth proxies.\\n\\nObject detection in images: For an object detection model, as new images are scored, there are no new labels being generated automatically. One option to obtain the ground truth for the new images is to use people to manually label the images.

Instrumentation is mostly supported for compiled languages like .NET and Java, and some languages interpreted at runtime like Python and Javascript. Keep in mind that enabling instrumentation can require to modify your build pipeline, i.e. by adding special parameters to the command line argument.

A metric represents a point in time measure of a particular source, and data-wise tends to be very small. The compact size allows for efficient collection even at scale in large systems. Metrics also lend themselves very well to pre-aggregation within the component before collection, reducing computation cost for processing & storing large numbers of metric time series in a central system. Due to how efficiently metrics are processed & stored, it lends itself very well for use in automated alerting, as metrics are an excellent source for the health data for all components in the system.\\n\\nLogs\\n\\nLog data inform observers about the discrete events that occurred within a component or a set of components. Just about every software component log information about its activities over time. This rich data tends to be much larger than metric data and can cause processing issues, especially if components are logging too verbosely. Therefore, using log data to understand the health of an extensive system tends to be avoided and depends on metrics for that data. Once metric telemetry highlights potential problem sources, filtered log data for those sources can be used to understand what occurred.\\n\\nTraces',\n",

       "  'chunkContent': \"Things to Watch for when Building Observable Systems\\n\\nObservability as an afterthought\\n\\nOne of the design goals when building a system should be to enable monitoring of the system. This helps planning and thinking application availability, logging and metrics at the time of design and development. Observability also acts as a great debugging tool providing developers a bird's eye view of the system. By leaving instrumentation and logging of metrics towards the end, the development teams lose valuable insights during development.\\n\\nMetric Fatigue\\n\\nIt is recommended to collect and measure what you need and not what you can. Don't attempt to monitor everything.\\n\\nIf the data is not actionable, it is useless and becomes noise. On the contrary, it is sometimes very difficult to forecast every possible scenario that could go wrong.\\n\\nThere must be a balance between collecting what is needed vs. logging every single activity in the system. A general rule of thumb is to follow these principles\\n\\nrules that catch incidents must be simple, relevant and reliable\\n\\nany data that is collected but not aggregated or alerted on must be reviewed if it is still required.\\n\\nContext\\n\\nAll data logged must contain rich context, which is useful for getting an overall view of the system and easy to trace back errors/failures during troubleshooting. While logging data, care must also be taken to avoid data silos.\\n\\nPersonally Identifiable Information\",\n",

It can be used to see which functions are the most costly in your binary, allowing you to focus your effort on removing the largest inefficiencies as quickly as possible. It can help you find deadlocks, memory leaks, or inefficient memory allocation, and help inform decisions around resource allocation (ie: CPU or RAM).\\n\\nHow to Profile your Applications\\n\\nProfiling is somewhat language dependent, so start off by searching for \"profile $language\" (some common tools are listed below). Additionally, Linux Perf is a good fallback, since a lot of languages have bindings in C/C++.\\n\\nProfiling does incur some cost, as it requires inspecting the call stack, and sometimes pausing the application all together (ie: to trigger a full GC in Java). It is recommended to continuously profile your services, say for 10s every 10 minutes. Consider the cost when deciding on tuning these parameters.\\n\\nDifferent tools visualize profiles differently. Common CPU profiles might use a directed graph  or a flame graph.\\n\\nUnfortunately, each profiler tool typically uses its own format for storing profiles, and comes with its own visualization.\\n\\nSpecific tools',\n",

Adopting open-source standards related to implementing telemetry and tracing features built on top of the OpenTelemetry framework helps decouple vendor-specific implementations while maintaining an extensible, standard, and portable open-source solution.\\n\\nOpenTelemetry is an open-source observability standard that defines how to generate, collect and describe telemetry in distributed systems. OpenTelemetry also provides a single-point distribution of a set of APIs, SDKs, and instrumentation libraries that implements the open-source standard, which can collect, process, and orchestrate telemetry data (signals) like traces, metrics, and logs. It supports multiple popular languages (Java, .NET, Python, JavaScript, Golang, Erlang, etc.). Open telemetry follows a vendor-agnostic and standards-based approach for collecting and managing telemetry data. An important point to note is that OpenTelemetry does not have its own backend; all telemetry collected by OpenTelemetry Collector must be sent to a backend like Prometheus, Jaeger, Zipkin, Azure Monitor, etc. Open telemetry is also the 2nd most active CNCF project only after Kubernetes.',\n",

There is plenty of available information about how the SDK and the automatic instrumentation are configured and how the Exporters, Tracers, Context, and Span's hierarchy work. See the Reference section for valuable OpenTelemetry resources.\\n\\nHowever, understanding the core implementation patterns will help you know what approach better fits the scenario you are trying to solve. These are three main patterns as follows:\\n\\nAutomatic telemetry: Support for automatic instrumentation is available for some languages. OpenTelemetry automatic instrumentation (100% codeless) is typically done through library hooks or monkey-patching library code. Automatic instrumentation will intercept all interactions and dependencies and automatically send the telemetry to the configured exporters. More information about this concept can be found in the OpenTelemetry instrumentation doc.\",\n",

Also, by using the @WithSpan annotations (method decorations in C# and Java) to mark whole methods that will be automatically traced.\\n\\nHybrid approach: Most Production-ready scenarios will require a mix of both techniques, using the automatic instrumentation to collect automatic telemetry and the OpenTelemetry SDK to identify code segments that are important to instrument manually. When considering production-ready scenarios, the hybrid approach is the way to go as it allows for a throughout cover over the whole solution.

The collector has two different deployment strategies – either running as an agent alongside a service or as a gateway which is a remote application. In general, using both is recommended: the agent would be deployed with your service and run as a separate process or in a sidecar; meanwhile, the collector would be deployed separately, as its own application running in a container or virtual machine. Each agent would forward telemetry data to the collector, which could then export it to a variety of backend systems such as Lightstep, Jaeger, or Prometheus. The agent can be also replaced with the automatic instrumentation if supported. The automatic instrumentation provides the collector capabilities of retrieving, processing and exporting the telemetry.\\n\\nRegardless of how you choose to instrument or deploy OpenTelemetry, exporters provide powerful options for reporting telemetry data. You can directly export from your service, you can proxy through the collector, or you can aggregate into standalone collectors – or even a mix of these.\\n\\nInstrumentation Libraries',\n",

Sensitive data could be exposed or tampered with to allow further exploits. All products and services must encrypt data in transit using approved cryptographic protocols and algorithms.

    "\n",
    "- Retrieval - also called L1, has the goal to quickly find all the documents from the index that satisfy the search criteria (possibly across millions or billions of documents). These are scored to pick the top few (typically in order of 50) to return to the user or to feed the next layer. Azure AI Search supports three different models:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Keyword: Uses traditional full-text search methods – content is broken into terms through language-specific text analysis, inverted indexes are created for fast retrieval, and the BM25 probabilistic model is used for scoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Vector: Documents are converted from text to vector representations using an embedding model. Retrieval is performed by generating a query embedding and finding the documents whose vectors are closest to the query’s. We used Azure Open AI text-embedding-ada-002 (Ada-002) embeddings and cosine similarity for all our tests in this post.\n",
    "  - Hybrid: Performs both keyword and vector retrieval and applies a fusion step to select the best results from each technique. Azure AI Search currently uses Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to produce a single result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ranking – also called L2, takes a subset of the top L1 results and computes higher quality relevance scores to reorder the result set. The L2 can improve the L1's ranking because it applies more computational power to each result. The L2 ranker can only reorder what the L1 already found – if the L1 missed an ideal document, the L2 can't fix that. L2 ranking is critical for RAG applications to make sure the best results are in the top positions.\n",
    "  - Semantic ranking is performed by Azure AI Search's L2 ranker which utilizes multi-lingual, deep learning models adapted from Microsoft Bing. The Semantic ranker can rank the top 50 results from the L1.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ai-azure-ai-services-blog/azure-ai-search-outperforming-vector-search-with-hybrid/ba-p/3929167 -->\n",
    "\n",
    "There are [various types of search](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/use-your-data?tabs=ai-search#search-options) that one can perform such as: keyword search, semantic search, vector search, hybrid search. Since we generated embeddings for our chunks and we would like to leverage the power of vector search, in this baseline solution we will perform a simple vector search. Further discussion and experimentation will be done in `Chapter 3. Experimentation - Search`\n"

DevSecOps teams, therefor have to take extra precautions during the Develop Phase to avoid high-risk development practices.\\n\\nThe development team may rely on a single modern integrated development environment (IDE) or disparate tools, specific to each task above. Committing to reducing the number of tools used by the team or having those tools integrated, presents opportunities for software developers to get early feedback while developing software that helps to improve the organization's overall security posture from the ground up.\\n\\nSome of the benefits of a modern IDE such as Visual Studio [^1] or Visual Studio Code [^2] include but are not limited to:\\n\\nLinting tools to improve code speed and quality.\",\n",

The development ecosystem used within the develop phase must ensure a record of all the dependencies is captured. Examples of this component inventory include application package managers (npm, NuGet, go.mod), OS package managers (winget, apt get), and container manifests (dockerfile).

For simplicity, the content in this section differ from the Capabilities Map in that content is segmented into four standard DevOps pipeline phases - Plan, Develop, Deliver, Operate. These phases are continuous, dependent on each other and not role-specific. DevSecOps secures each phase of a continuous DevOps pipeline as security is designed, integrated, and validated throughout. While every pipeline is unique, similar workflows are reflected in most organizations application.\\n\\nThe phases, Plan, Develop, Deliver, Operate, in use align with public facing Microsoft references for consistency. See reference list below.\\n\\nThe next section describes the chronological phases in detail.\\n\\nCapability Phases\\n\\nPlan: It all starts with planning. This phase involves collaboration, discussion, review, and strategy of security analysis. Teams define security requirements, perform a security analysis and create a plan that outlines where, how, and when security testing will be done.\\n\\nDevelop: This phase includes all aspects of code writing, testing, reviewing, and the integration of code by team members as well as building that code into build artifacts that can be deployed into various environments.\\n\\nDeploy: This phase is where software moves from testing to live production which encompasses securing deployment and compliance.',\n",
